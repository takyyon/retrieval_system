Snippets for the query:  I'd like to find articles describing the use of singular value decomposition in digital image processing. Applications include finding approximations to the original image and restoring images that are subject to noise. An article on the subject is H. Andrews and C. Patterson "Outer product expansions and their uses in digital image processing", American Mathematical Andrews, H. Patterson, C.

NEATER2: A PL/I Source Statement Reformatter

NEATER2 accepts a PL/I source program and operates on it to produce
a reformatted version.  When in the LOGICAL mode, NEATER2 indicates
the logical structure of the source program in the indentation
pattern of its output.  Logic errors discovered through NEATER2
logical analysis are discovered much more economically than is possible
through compilation and trial runs.  A number of options are
available to give <B>the use</B>r full control over the output format and
to maximize the utility of NEATER2 as an aid during the early
stages of development of a PL/I source deck.  One option, USAGE, causes
NEATER2 to insert into each logical unit of coding a statement
which will case the number of times each one is executed to be recorded
during execution.  This feature is expected to provide a
major aid in optimization of PL/I programs.

A Policy-Driven Scheduler for a Time-Sharing System

The service received by a process from a time-sharing
operating system can be characterized 
by a resource count SUM{w[i]R[ij]} where R[ij] is the
number of units of service received by process 
i from resource i and w[i] is the cost per unit of the
service.  Each class of users can be characterized 
by a policy function which specifies the amount of service
a user who belongs to this class should receive 
as a function of time.  Priority changes dynamically
as a function of the difference between the service 
promised <B>to the</B> user by the policy function and the service
he actually receives.  A scheduling and swapping 
algorithm which keeps the resource count of each process
above its policy function will provide the specified 
level of service.  Overhead can be reduced by avoiding
swaps of process which have received at least 
his level of service.  The algorithm has been implemented
in a general purpose operating system, and 
it has provided significantly better service to interactive
and to batch jobs than the previous scheduler.

On Lions' Counter Example for Gotlieb's Method
for the Construction of School Timetables

The timetable problem is an essentially discrete
problem. Although the discrete problem may 
have no feasible solution, there may exist a solution
<B>to the</B> equivalent continuous problem.  An example 
is given, for which the nondiscrete solution can be
interpreted as a set of timetables, differing from 
week to week, which together satisfy the long-term
requirements of the timetable problem.

A Note on Storage Fragmentation and Program Segmentation

The main purpose of this paper is the presentation
of some of the results of a series of simulation 
experiments investigating the phenomenon of storage fragmentation.
 Two different types of storage fragmentation 
are distinguished: (1) external fragmentation, namely the
loss in storage utilization caused by the inability 
to make <B>use of</B> all available storage after it has been
fragmented into a large number of separate blocks; 
and (2) internal fragmentation, the loss of utilization
caused by rounding up a request for storage, 
rather than allocating only the exact number of words required.
 The most striking result is the apparently 
general rule that rounding up requests for storage,
to reduce the number of different sizes of blocks 
coexisting in storage, causes more loss of storage
by increased internal fragmentation than is saved 
by decreased external fragmentation.  Described also are
a method of segment allocation and an accompanying 
technique for segment addressing which take advantage
of the above result.  Evidence is presented of 
possible advantages of the method over conventional paging techniques.

Multiprogram Scheduling Parts 1 and 2.  Introduction and Theory*

In order to exploit fully a fast computer which
possesses simultaneous processing abilities, 
it should to a large extent schedule its own workload.
 The scheduling routine must be capable of extremely 
rapid execution if it is not to prove self-defeating.
 The construction of a schedule entails determining 
which programs are to be run concurrently and which sequentially
with respect to each other.  A concise 
scheduling algorithm is described which tends to minimize
the time for executing the entire pending workload 
(or any subset of it), <B>subject to</B> external constraints
such as precedence, urgency, etc.  The algorithm 
is applicable to a wide class of machines.

Flow Diagrams, Turing Machines And
Languages With Only Two Formation Rules

In the first part of the paper, flow diagrams
are introduced to represent inter al. mappings 
of a set into itself.  Although not every diagram is
decomposable into a finite number of given base 
diagrams, this becomes true at a semantical level due
to a suitable extension of the given set and of 
the basic mappings defined in it.  Two normalization
methods of flow diagrams are given.  The first has 
three base diagrams; the second, only two.  In the second
part of the paper, the second method is applied 
<B>to the</B> theory of Turing machines.  With every Turing
machine provided with a two-way half-tape, there 
is associated a similar machine, doing essentially
the same job, but working on a tape obtained from 
the first one by interspersing alternate blank squares.
 The new machine belongs to the family, elsewhere 
introduced, generated by composition and iteration from
the two machines L and R.  That family is a proper 
subfamily of the whole family of Turing machines.

The Next 700 Programming Languages 

A family of unimplemented computing languages
is described that is intended to span differences 
of application area by a unified framework.  This framework
dictates the rules about <B>the use</B>s of user-coined 
names, and the conventions about characterizing functional
relationships.  Within this framework the 
design of a specific language splits into two independent
parts.  One is the choice of written appearances 
of programs (or more generally, their physical representation).
 The other is the choice of the abstract 
entities (such as numbers, character-strings, lists
of them, functional relations among them) that can 
be referred to in the language.  The system is biased
towards "expressions" rather than "statements." 
 It includes a nonprocedural(purely functional) subsystem
that aims to expand the class of users' needs 
that can be met by a single print-instruction, without sacrificing
the important properties that make 
conventional right-hand-side expressions easy to construct and understand.

Extremely Portable Random Number Generator

Extremely portable subroutines are sometimes
needed for which moderate quality and efficiency 
suffice.  Typically, this occurs for library functions
(like random number generation and in core sorting) 
which are not entirely universal or are not used in a
standardized way.  The literature on random number 
generators does not seem to contain an algorithm that
meets requirements of this sort.  An extremely 
portable 8-line FORTRAN program is provided which based
on an important paper by Coveyou and MacPherson 
(1967)sing their methods, Fourier analysis is applied
<B>to the</B> probability function for the consecutive 
n-tuples provided by our generator (with n less than
or equal to 4).  While the small modulus which must 
be used to maintain portability prevents the quality
of the generator from being high, the generator 
compares well with the bounds established in the above mentioned paper.

An Algorithm for Finding a Fundamental Set of Cycles of a Graph

A fast method is presented for finding a fundamental
set of cycles for an undirected finite 
graph.  A spanning tree is grown and the vertices examined
in turn, unexamined vertices being stored 
in a pushdown list to await examination.  One stage
in the process is to take the top element v of the 
pushdown list and examine it, i.e. inspect all those
edges (v,z) of the graph for which z has not yet 
been examined.  If z is already in the tree, a fundamental
cycle is added; if not, the edge (v,z) is 
placed in the tree.  There is exactly one such stage
for each of the n vertices of the graph.  For large 
n, the store required in creases as n^2 and the time as
n^g where g depends <B>on the</B> type of graph involved. 
 g is bounded below by 2 and above by 3, and it is shown
that both bounds are attained.  In terms of 
storage our algorithm is similar to that of Gotlieb and
Corneil and superior to that of Welch; in terms 
of speed it is similar to that of Welch and superior
to that of Gotlieb and Corneil.  Testsshow our 
algorithm to be remarkably efficient (g=2) on random graphs.

Dynamic Storage Allocation Systems

In many recent computer system designs, hardware
facilities have been provided for easing the 
problems of storage allocation.  A method of characterizing
dynamic storage allocation systems-according 
<B>to the</B> functional capabilities provided and the underlying
techniques used-is presented.  The basic purpose 
of the paper is to provide a useful perspective from
which the utility of various hardware facilities 
may be assessed.  A brief survey of storage allocation
facilities in several representative computer 
systems is included as an appendix.

Relative Effects of Central Processor and Input-Output
Speeds Upon Throughput <B>on the</B> Large Computer

Presented in this paper is a technique for
determining the relative effects of the internal 
speed of the computer and the speed of the input-output
units upon the overall speed of the system. Equations 
are derived which permit the determination of these
effects from hardware usage measurements.

Permutation of Data Blocks in a Bubble Memory

A common internal organization of bubble memories consists of a set of (minor) 
loops, connected through another (major) loop.  The problem of obtaining any 
give n permutation of the minor loop contents in minimum time is studied
in this paper.  A lower bound <B>to the</B> number of steps required buy
a permutation algorithm is derived, and the class of optimum algorithms is 
identified.

Automatic Derivation of Microsentences

The decomposition of long complex English sentences
into shorter kernel-like constituent sentences 
(microsentences)has often been suggested as an avenue
toward conducting automatic retrieval of natural 
language messages.  To explore the prospects of such
a step, the authors attempted in 1963 to prepare 
a general program for deriving microsentences from longer
sentences that had been syntactically analyzed 
by the Harvard Multipath Analysis Program.  The basic
idea was to extract <B>the subject</B>, verb and object 
(if any) of each clause and to reassemble these materials
into a grammatical microsentence.  A program 
is described in this paper, which was designed to operate
on the tree structure output of the analyzer, 
and the microsentences that were produced are exhibited.
 The authors conclude that while microsentences 
of the quality achieved do not open up immediate prospects
for improving the performance of automatic 
message retrieval systems, they may have practical
value in man-machine systems using human monitors 
to select the preferred syntactic interpretation of a sentence.

A Proposal for Definitions in ALGOL

An extension to ALGOL is proposed for adding
new data types and operators <B>to the</B> language. 
 Definitions may occur in any block heading and terminate
with the block.  They are an integral part 
of the program and are not fixed in the language.  Even
the behavior of existing operators may be redefined. 
 The processing of text containing defined contexts features
a "replacement rule" that eliminates unnecessary 
iterations and temporary storage.  Examples of definition sets
are given for real and complex matrices, 
complex numbers, file processing, and list manipulation.

Optimal Surface Reconstruction from Planar Contours

In many scientific and technical endeavors,
a three-dimensional solid must be reconstructed 
from serial sections, either to aid in the comprehension
of the object's structure or to facilitate its 
automatic manipulation and analysis.  This paper presents
a general solution <B>to the</B> problem of constructing 
a surface over a set of cross-sectional contours. 
This surface, to be composed of triangular tiles, 
is constructed by separately determining an optimal
surface between each pair of consecutive contours.
 Determining such a surface is reduced to the problem
of finding certain minimum cost cycles in a directed 
toroidal graph.  A new fast algorithm for finding such
cycles is utilized.  Also developed is a closed-form 
expression, in term of the number of contour poin ts, for
an upper bound on the number of operations required 
to execute the algorithm.  An illustrated example which
involves the construction of a minimum area surface 
describing a human head is included.

from serial sections, either to aid in the comprehension
of the object's structure or to facilitate its 
automatic manipulation and analysis.  This paper presents
a general solution to the problem of constructing 
a surface over a set of cross-sectional contours. 
This surface, to be composed of triangular tiles, 
is constructed by separately determining an optimal
surface between each pair of consecutive contours.
 Determining such a surface is reduced to the problem
of finding certain minimum cost cycles in a directed 
toroidal graph.  A new fast algorithm for finding such
cycles is utilized.  Also developed is a closed-form 
expression, in term of the number of contour poin ts, for
an upper bound <B>on the</B> number of operations required 
to execute the algorithm.  An illustrated example which
involves the construction of a minimum area surface 
describing a human head is included.

Simulation of Radioisotope Scans by Computer

In radioisotope scanning, a field which is assuming
increasing importance in medical diagnosis, 
the scan is a two-dimensional pattern made up of dots.
 Areas of increased source activity are represented 
<B>on the</B> scan by areas of increased dot density.  To study
the output of scanners with various characteristics, 
a program which simulates radioisotope scans has been
written  for a PDP-1 computer with auxiliary disk 
storage and cathode ray tube display.  Past and present
research using the output of the simulator has 
shown the flexibility of the system to be important.
 The structure of this program can be useful in 
the simulation of the output of any quantum-limited system.

A Stochastic Approach to the Grammatical Coding of English

A computer program is described which will

through the <B>use of</B> a small dictionary of function 
words and frequently occurring lexical words.  Some suffix
tests and logical-decision rules are employed 
to code additional words.  Finally, the remaining words
are assigned to one class or another on the basis 
of the most probable form classes to occur within the already
identified contexts.  The conditional probabilities 
used as a basis for this coding were empirically derived
from a separate hand-coded corpusn preliminary 
trials, the accuracy of the coder was 91% to 93%, with
obvious ways of improving the algorithm being

CONVERT

A programming language is described which
is applicable to problems conveniently described 
by transformation rules.  By this is meant that patterns
may be prescribed, each being associated with 
a skeleton, so that a series of such pairs may be searched
until a pattern is found which matches an 
expression to be transformed.  The conditions for a match
are governed by a code which also allows subexpressions 
to be identified and eventually substituted in<B>to the</B>
corresponding skeleton.  The primitive patterns 
and primitive skeletons are described, as well as the
principle which allow their elaboration in to more 
complicated patterns and skeletons.  The advantages of the
language are that it allows one to apply transformation 
rules to lists and arrays as easily as strings, that both
patterns and skeletons may be defined recursively, 
and that as a consequence programs may be stated quite concisely.

The Use of Normal Multiplication Tables
for Information Storage and Retrieval

This paper describes a method for the organization and retrieval of attribute 
based information systems, using the normal multiplication table as a directory
for the information system.  Algorithms for the organization an
d retrieval of information are described.  This method is particularly
suitable for queries requesting a group of information items,
 all of which possess a particular set of attributes (and possibly
some other attributes as well).  Several examples are given; the
results with respect <B>to the</B> number of disk accesses and disk space
are compared to other common approaches.  Algorithms evaluating
the appropriateness of the above approach to a given information system
are described.  For a certain class of information systems,
the normal multiplication table method yields far more rapid retrieval
with a more economical space requirement than conventional systems.  
Moreover this method incorporates an improved modification of the inverted 
file technique.

A Nonrecursive Method of Syntax Specification

The <B>use of</B> the Kleene regular expression notation
for describing algebraic language syntax, 
in particular of ALGOL, is described in this paper. 
A FORTRAN II computer program for carrying out the 
elimination algorithm of Gorn,similar to Gaussian elimination
for linear systems of algebraic equations, 
is described.  This was applied to numerous smaller
languages, including some sublanguage of ALGOL.  
A hand calculation result of the application of the algorithm
to all of ALGOL is given, thus expressing 
the Revised ALGOL 1960 syntax in completely nonrecursive
terms, as far as its context-free portion is 
concerned.  This description in many ways is far more
intuitively understood than the previous recursive 
description, it is suggested.  The paper also includes
results of the machine program, which does not 
include a simplification algorithm.

On the Normalization Requirement of
Divisor in Divide- and- Correct Methods

This paper presents an analysis on the normalization
requirement of the divisor in a divide-and-correct 
method.  This analysis is made subject <B>to the</B> condition
that not more than one correction is required 
to obtain the true quotient character, from the trial
estimate got from the division of a two-precision 
segment of every partial remainder by a suitably rounded
single-precision divisor.  (This segmented division 
is denoted here as a (2, 1) precision basic division.)
 It is found that the normalization requirement 
could be narrowed down to a smaller range of divisors,
provided the magnitude of the character next to 
the leading character of the divisor is known.  If,
however, the normalization is to be eliminated one 
has to choose proper higher precision segments of operands
for the basic division.  Also considered is 
the possibility of eliminating the normalization by an
increase on the number of corrections on the quotient 
estimate got from a (2, 1) precision basic division.
 It is shown that such a scheme is economical only 
for small radices.

A Simple User-Oriented Compiler Source Language
for Programming Automatic Test Equipment

For the nonprogrammer, difficulty in using
a language increases rapidly with the number of 
nonproblem-oriented conventions.  A simple language, even
if inelegant, which considers <B>the use</B>r's background 
as part of the problem may be more effective than a source
language containing subtle and more powerful 
capabilities.  The language described in this paper is
used to write computer programs which test electronic 
equipment.  Because this testing process contains few
complex ideas, there is little need for the elegance 
and redundancy of a highly syntax-oriented language.
 A simple and direct language will suffice for the 
problem.  The eventual users of this language are military
depot personnel who cannot he expected to 
have computer programming skill or significant programming
training.  For this nonprogramming-oriented 
user, it was essential to create a language using familiar
engineering statements; programming-oriented 
conventions would have unnecessarily complicated his task.

A Record and File Partitioning Model

One of the main objectives in the design of
a file system is the reduction of storage and data 
transfer costs.  This paper presents a model in which
several  requests access the file system, and each 
request requires information from one or more variable
length data-items.  The probabilities of access 
and the distribution of each data-item's length are assumed
to be known, and to be mutually independent. 
The file system uses one or more storage devices, and
each record may be partitioned into subrecords 
<B>that are</B> stored on different devices.  One of the subrecords
is designated as the primary record; when 
a request for a record is made, the primary record is
first accessed, and other subrecords are accessed 
only if the pertinent information is not stored in the
primary record.  The model that is presented in 
this paper, both as a nonlinear programming model and
a mixed integer programming model, is a very general 
one; several types of file systems may be derived from
it by an appropriate selection of its parameters. 
 This model has already been used in the optimization of
library routines' storage at a large scale operating 
system.

Creation and Control of Internal Data Bases
Under a Fortran Programming Environment

A method is described for the definition of a user's COMMON structure
and the automatic generation of the necessary COMMON, DIMENSION, EQUIVALENCE,
and type declarations for each of the user's routines.  The definition
for the COMMON is contained in an easy to modify form, thus
allowing the control of general communications of data between routines.
The described system has been implemented <B>on the</B> IBM 7094,
CDC 6000 series, and the IBM 360.  The method has proved to be invaluable
for the definition and control of COMMON in many large-scale programs.

The Denotational Semantics of Programming Languages

This paper is a tutorial introduction <B>to the</B>
theory of programming language semantics developed 
by D. Scott and C. Strachey.  The application of the theory
to formal language specification is demonstrated 
and other applications are surveyed. The first language
considered, LOOP, is very elementary and its 
definition merely introduces the notation and methodology
of the approach.  Then the semantic concepts
of environments, stores, and continuations are introduced
to model classes of programming language features 
and the underlying mathematical theory of computation
due to Scott is motivated and outlined.  Finally, 
the paper presents a formal definition of the language GEDANKEN.
