NEATER2: A PL/I Source Statement Reformatter

NEATER2 accepts a PL/I source program and operates on it to produce
a reformatted version.  When in the LOGICAL mode, NEATER2 indicates
the logical structure of the source program in the indentation
pattern of its output.  Logic errors discovered through NEATER2
logical analys<B>is a</B>re discovered much more economically than is possible
through compilation and trial runs.  A number of options are
available to give the user full control over the output format and
to maximize the utility of NEATER2 as an aid during the early
stages of development of a PL/I source deck.  One option, USAGE, causes
NEATER2 to insert into each logical unit of coding a statement
which will case the number of times each one is executed to be recorded
during execution.  This feature is expected to provide a
major aid in optimization of PL/I programs.

Efficient Implementation of a Variable Projection
Algorithm for Nonlinear Least Squares Problems

Nonlinear least squares frequently arise for which
the variables to be solved for can be separated 
into a linear and a nonlinear part.  A variable projection
algorithm has been developed recently which 
is designed to take advantage of the structure of a problem
whose variables separate in this way.  This 
paper gives a slightly more efficient and slightly more
general version of th<B>is a</B>lgorithm than has appeared 
earlier.

On Lions' Counter Example for Gotlieb's Method
for the Construction of School Timetables

The timetable problem <B>is a</B>n essentially discrete
problem. Although the discrete problem may 
have no feasible solution, there may exist a solution
to the equivalent continuous problem.  An example 
is given, for which the nondiscrete solution can be
interpreted as a set of timetables, differing from 
week to week, which together satisfy the long-term

On the Normalization Requirement of
Divisor in Divide- and- Correct Methods

This paper presents an analysis on the normalization
requirement of the divisor in a divide-and-correct 
method.  Th<B>is a</B>nalysis is made subject to the condition
that not more than one correction is required 
to obtain the true quotient character, from the trial
estimate got from the division of a two-precision 
segment of every partial remainder by a suitably rounded
single-precision divisor.  (This segmented division 
is denoted here as a (2, 1) precision basic division.)
 It is found that the normalization requirement 
could be narrowed down to a smaller range of divisors,
provided the magnitude of the character next to 
the leading character of the divisor is known.  If,
however, the normalization is to be eliminated one 
has to choose proper higher precision segments of operands
for the basic division.  Also considered is 
the possibility of eliminating the normalization by an
increase on the number of corrections on the quotient 
estimate got from a (2, 1) precision basic division.
 It is shown that such a scheme is economical only 
for small radices.

An Algorithm for Finding a Fundamental Set of Cycles of a Graph

A fast method is presented for finding a fundamental
set of cycles for an undirected finite 
graph.  A spanning tree is grown and the vertices examined
in turn, unexamined vertices being stored 
in a pushdown list to await examination.  One stage
in the process is to take the top element v of the 
pushdown list and examine it, i.e. inspect all those
edges (v,z) of the graph for which z has not yet 
been examined.  If z <B>is a</B>lready in the tree, a fundamental
cycle is added; if not, the edge (v,z) is 
placed in the tree.  There is exactly one such stage
for each of the n vertices of the graph.  For large 
n, the store required in creases as n^2 and the time as
n^g where g depends on the type of graph involved. 
 g is bounded below by 2 and above by 3, and it is shown
that both bounds are attained.  In terms of 
storage our algorithm is similar to that of Gotlieb and
Corneil and superior to that of Welch; in terms 
of speed it is similar to that of Welch and superior
to that of Gotlieb and Corneil.  Testsshow our 
algorithm to be remarkably efficient (g=2) on random graphs.

Multiprogram Scheduling Parts 1 and 2.  Introduction and Theory*

In order to exploit fully a fast computer which
possesses simultaneous processing abilities, 
it should to a large extent schedule its own workload.
 The scheduling routine must be capable of extremely 
rapid execution if it is not to prove self-defeating.
 The construction of a schedule entails determining 
which programs are to be run concurrently and which sequentially
with respect to each other.  A concise 
scheduling algorithm is described which tends to minimize
the time for executing the entire pending workload 
(or any subset of it), subject to external constraints
such as precedence, urgency, etc.  The algorithm 
<B>is a</B>pplicable to a wide class of machines.

Simulation of Radioisotope Scans by Computer

In radioisotope scanning, a field which <B>is a</B>ssuming
increasing importance in medical diagnosis, 
the scan is a two-dimensional pattern made up of dots.
 Areas of increased source activity are represented 
on the scan by areas of increased dot density.  To study
the output of scanners with various characteristics, 
a program which simulates radioisotope scans has been
written  for a PDP-1 computer with auxiliary disk 
storage and cathode ray tube display.  Past and present
research using the output of the simulator has 
shown the flexibility of the system to be important.
 The structure of this program can be useful in 
the simulation of the output of any quantum-limited system.

Flow Diagrams, Turing Machines And
Languages With Only Two Formation Rules

In the first part of the paper, flow diagrams
are introduced to represent inter al. mappings 
of a set into itself.  Although not every diagram is
decomposable into a finite number of given base 
diagrams, this becomes true at a semantical level due
to a suitable extension of the given set and of 
the basic mappings defined in it.  Two normalization
methods of flow diagrams are given.  The first has 
three base diagrams; the second, only two.  In the second
part of the paper, the second method <B>is a</B>pplied 
to the theory of Turing machines.  With every Turing
machine provided with a two-way half-tape, there 
is associated a similar machine, doing essentially
the same job, but working on a tape obtained from 
the first one by interspersing alternate blank squares.
 The new machine belongs to the family, elsewhere 
introduced, generated by composition and iteration from
the two machines L and R.  That family is a proper 
subfamily of the whole family of Turing machines.

Extremely Portable Random Number Generator

Extremely portable subroutines are sometimes
needed for which moderate quality and efficiency 
suffice.  Typically, this occurs for library functions
(like random number generation and in core sorting) 
which are not entirely universal or are not used in a
standardized way.  The literature on random number 
generators does not seem to contain an algorithm that
meets requirements of this sort.  An extremely 
portable 8-line FORTRAN program is provided which based
on an important paper by Coveyou and MacPherson 
(1967)sing their methods, Fourier analysis <B>is a</B>pplied
to the probability function for the consecutive 
n-tuples provided by our generator (with n less than
or equal to 4).  While the small modulus which must 
be used to maintain portability prevents the quality
of the generator from being high, the generator 
compares well with the bounds established in the above mentioned paper.

Performance of Height-Balanced Trees

This paper presents the results of simulations
that investigate the performance of height-balanced 
(HB[k]) trees.  It is shown that the only statistic
of HB[1] trees (AVL trees) that <B>is a</B> function of 
the size of the tree is the time to search for an item
in the tree.  For sufficiently large trees, the 
execution times of all procedures for maintaining HB[1]
trees are independent of the size of the tree. 
 In particular, an average of .465 restructures are required
per insertion, with an average of 2.78 nodes 
revisited to restore the HB[1] property; an average of
 .214 restructures are required per deletion, with 
an average of 1.91 nodes revisited to restore the HB[1]
property.  Moreover,the execution times of procedures 
for maintaining HB[k] trees, for k>1, are also independent
of the size of the tree except for the average 
number of nodes revisited on a delete operation in
order to restore the HB[k] property on trace back. 
 The cost of maintaining HB[k] trees drops sharply as the
allowable imbalance (k) increases.  Both analytical 
and experimental results that show the cost of maintaining
HB[k] trees as a function of k are discussed.

A programming language is described which
<B>is a</B>pplicable to problems conveniently described 
by transformation rules.  By this is meant that patterns
may be prescribed, each being associated with 
a skeleton, so that a series of such pairs may be searched
until a pattern is found which matches an 
expression to be transformed.  The conditions for a match
are governed by a code which also allows subexpressions 
to be identified and eventually substituted into the
corresponding skeleton.  The primitive patterns 
and primitive skeletons are described, as well as the
principle which allow their elaboration in to more 
complicated patterns and skeletons.  The advantages of the
language are that it allows one to apply transformation 
rules to lists and arrays as easily as strings, that both
patterns and skeletons may be defined recursively, 
and that as a consequence programs may be stated quite concisely.

The Denotational Semantics of Programming Languages

This paper <B>is a</B> tutorial introduction to the
theory of programming language semantics developed 
by D. Scott and C. Strachey.  The application of the theory
to formal language specification is demonstrated 
and other applications are surveyed. The first language
considered, LOOP, is very elementary and its 
definition merely introduces the notation and methodology
of the approach.  Then the semantic concepts
of environments, stores, and continuations are introduced
to model classes of programming language features 
and the underlying mathematical theory of computation
due to Scott is motivated and outlined.  Finally, 
the paper presents a formal definition of the language GEDANKEN.

A Record and File Partitioning Model

One of the main objectives in the design of
a file system is the reduction of storage and data 
transfer costs.  This paper presents a model in which
several  requests access the file system, and each 
request requires information from one or more variable
length data-items.  The probabilities of access 
and the distribution of each data-item's length are assumed
to be known, and to be mutually independent. 
The file system uses one or more storage devices, and
each record may be partitioned into subrecords 
that are stored on different devices.  One of the subrecords
is designated as the primary record; when 
a request for a record is made, the primary record is
first accessed, and other subrecords are accessed 
only if the pertinent information is not stored in the
primary record.  The model that is presented in 
this paper, both as a nonlinear programming model and
a mixed integer programming model, <B>is a</B> very general 
one; several types of file systems may be derived from
it by an appropriate selection of its parameters. 
 This model has already been used in the optimization of
library routines' storage at a large scale operating 
system.

Optimal Surface Reconstruction from Planar Contours

In many scientific and technical endeavors,
a three-dimensional solid must be reconstructed 
from serial sections, either to aid in the comprehension
of the object's structure or to facilitate its 
automatic manipulation and analysis.  This paper presents
a general solution to the problem of constructing 
a surface over a set of cross-sectional contours. 
This surface, to be composed of triangular tiles, 
is constructed by separately determining an optimal
surface between each pair of consecutive contours.
 Determining such a surface is reduced to the problem
of finding certain minimum cost cycles in a directed 
toroidal graph.  A new fast algorithm for finding such
cycles is utilized.  Also developed <B>is a</B> closed-form 
expression, in term of the number of contour poin ts, for
an upper bound on the number of operations required 
to execute the algorithm.  An illustrated example which
involves the construction of a minimum area surface 
describing a human head is included.
