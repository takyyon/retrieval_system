NEATER2: A PL/I Source Statement Reformatter

NEATER2 accepts a PL/I source program and operates on it to produce
a reformatted version.  When in the LOGICAL mode, NEATER2 indicates
the logical structure of the source program in the indentation
pattern of its output.  Logic errors discovered through NEATER2
logical analysis are discovered much more economically than is possible
through compilation and trial runs.  A number of options are
available to give the user full control over the output format and
to maximize the utility of NEATER2 as an aid during the early
stages of development of a PL/I source deck.  One option, USAGE, causes
NEATER2 to insert into each logical unit of coding a statement
which will case the number of times each one is executed to be recorded
during execution.  This feature is expected to provide a
major aid in <B>optimization of</B> PL/I programs.

A Record and File Partitioning Model

One of the main objectives in the design of
a file system is the reduction of storage and data 
transfer costs.  This paper presents a model in which
several  requests access the file system, and each 
request requires information from one or more variable
length data-items.  The probabilities of access 
and the distribution of each data-item's length are assumed
to be known, and to be mutually independent. 
The file system uses one or more storage devices, and
each record may be partitioned into subrecords 
that are stored on different devices.  One of the subrecords
is designated as the primary record; when 
a request for a record is made, the primary record is
first accessed, and other subrecords are accessed 
only if the pertinent information is not stored in the
primary record.  The model that is presented in 
this paper, both as a nonlinear programming model and
a mixed integer programming model, is a very general 
one; several types of file systems may be derived from
it by an appropriate selection of its parameters. 
 This model has already been used in the <B>optimization of</B>
library routines' storage at a large scale operating 
system.
