A programming language is described which
is <B>applicable to</B> problems conveniently described 
by transformation rules.  By this is meant that patterns
may be prescribed, each being associated with 
a skeleton, so that a series of such pairs may be searched
until a pattern is found which matches an 
expression to be transformed.  The conditions for a match
are governed by a code which also allows subexpressions 
to be identified and eventually substituted into the
corresponding skeleton.  The primitive patterns 
and primitive skeletons are described, as well as the
principle which allow their elaboration in to more 
complicated patterns and skeletons.  The advantages of the
language are that it allows one to apply transformation 
rules to lists and arrays as easily as strings, that both
patterns and skeletons may be defined recursively, 
and that as a consequence programs may be stated quite concisely.

Multiprogram Scheduling Parts 1 and 2.  Introduction and Theory*

In order to exploit fully a fast computer which
possesses simultaneous processing abilities, 
it should to a large extent schedule its own workload.
 The scheduling routine must be capable of extremely 
rapid execution if it is not to prove self-defeating.
 The construction of a schedule entails determining 
which programs are to be run concurrently and which sequentially
with respect to each other.  A concise 
scheduling algorithm is described which tends to minimize
the time for executing the entire pending workload 
(or any subset of it), subject to external constraints
such as precedence, urgency, etc.  The algorithm 
is <B>applicable to</B> a wide class of machines.
