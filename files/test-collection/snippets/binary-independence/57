The Next 700 Programming Languages 

A family of unimplemented computing languages
is described that is intended to span differences 
of application area by a unified framework.  This framework
dictates the rules about the uses of user-coined 
names, and the conventions about characterizing functional
relationships.  Within this framework the 
design of a specific language splits into two independent
parts.  One is the choice of written appearances 
of programs (or more generally, their physical representation).
 The other is the choice of the abstract 
entities (such as numbers, character-strings, lists
of them, functional relations among them) that can 
be referred to in the language.  The system is biased
towards "expressions" rather than "statements." 
 It includes a nonprocedural(purely functional) subsystem
that aims to expand the class of users' needs 
that <B>can be</B> met by a single print-instruction, without sacrificing
the important properties that make 
conventional right-hand-side expressions easy to construct and understand.

A Policy-Driven Scheduler for a Time-Sharing System

The service received by a process from a time-sharing
operating system <B>can be</B> characterized 
by a resource count SUM{w[i]R[ij]} where R[ij] is the
number of units of service received by process 
i from resource i and w[i] is the cost per unit of the
service.  Each class of users can be characterized 
by a policy function which specifies the amount of service
a user who belongs to this class should receive 
as a function of time.  Priority changes dynamically
as a function of the difference between the service 
promised to the user by the policy function and the service
he actually receives.  A scheduling and swapping 
algorithm which keeps the resource count of each process
above its policy function will provide the specified 
level of service.  Overhead can be reduced by avoiding
swaps of process which have received at least 
his level of service.  The algorithm has been implemented
in a general purpose operating system, and 
it has provided significantly better service to interactive
and to batch jobs than the previous scheduler.

Efficient Implementation of a Variable Projection
Algorithm for Nonlinear Least Squares Problems

Nonlinear <B>least squares</B> frequently arise for which
the variables to be solved for can be separated 
into a linear and a nonlinear part.  A variable projection
algorithm has been developed recently which 
is designed to take advantage of the structure of a problem
whose variables separate in this way.  This 
paper gives a slightly more efficient and slightly more
general version of this algorithm than has appeared 
earlier.

On Lions' Counter Example for Gotlieb's Method
for the Construction of School Timetables

The timetable problem is an essentially discrete
problem. Although the discrete problem may 
have no feasible solution, there may exist a solution
to the equivalent continuous problem.  An example 
is given, for which the nondiscrete solution <B>can be</B>
interpreted as a set of timetables, differing from 
week to week, which together satisfy the long-term
requirements of the timetable problem.

Simulation of Radioisotope Scans by Computer

In radioisotope scanning, a field which is assuming
increasing importance in medical diagnosis, 
the scan is a two-dimensional pattern made up of dots.
 Areas of increased source activity are represented 
on the scan by areas of increased dot density.  To study
the output of scanners with various characteristics, 
a program which simulates radioisotope scans has been
written  for a PDP-1 computer with auxiliary disk 
storage and cathode ray tube display.  Past and present
research using the output of the simulator has 
shown the flexibility of the system to be important.
 The structure of this program <B>can be</B> useful in 
the simulation of the output of any quantum-limited system.
