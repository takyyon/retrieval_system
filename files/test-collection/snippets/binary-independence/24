Dynamic Document Processing

The current role <B>of computer</B>s in automatic
document processing is briefly outlined, and some 
reasons are given why the early promise of library automation
and of the mechanization of documentation 
processes has not been fulfilled.  A new dynamic document
environment is then outlined in which clustered
files are searched and information is retrieved following
an interactive user-controlled search process. 
 Methods are described for an automatic query modification
based on user needs, and for a continuous 
reorganization of the stored information as a function of
earlier file processing and of normal collection 
growth.  The proposed procedures provide powerful tools
for information retrieval and for the control 
of dynamic library collections in which new items
are continually added and old ones are retired.

Ancient Babylonian Algorithms

The early origins of mathematics are discussed,
emphasizing those aspects which seem to be 
of greatest interest from the standpoint <B>of computer</B>
science.  A number of old Babylonian tablets, many 
of which have never before been translated into English, are quoted.
