Snippets for the query:  I'd like to find articles describing graph algorithms that are based on the eigenvalue decomposition (or singular value decomposition) of the ajacency matrix for the graph. I'm especially interested in any heuristic algorithms for graph coloring and graph isomorphism using this method.

On an Algorithm for Nonlinear Minimax Approximation

Certain nonlinear minimax approximation problems are characterize
d by properties which permit the application of special algorithms,
mainly based on the exchange algorithms of Remes (1934, 1935), for
their solution.  In this paper the application to problems of this
type of a general nonlinear algorithm due to Osborne and Watson
(1969) is considered.  Examples are given to illustrate that this
algorithm can give satisfactory results and, in particular, can
successfully solve problems which lead to difficulties
with the more conventional specialist method.

Pictorial Pattern Recognition and the
Phase Problem of X-ray Crystallography

The availability of interactive, three-dimensional,
computer graphics systems coupled to powerful 
digital computers encourages the development of algorithms
adapted to this environment.  Pictorial pattern 
recognition techniques make possible a number of approaches
to X-ray structure determination based on 
molecular model building, i.e. the use of chemical information
to frame "structural hypotheses" which 
can computationally be tested and refined by reference
to the experimental data.  Application of standard 
pattern recognition algorithms is hindered by the fact
that the cross-correlation between a model and 
the correct structure cannot be computed because of
a fundamental incompleteness in the measured data. 
 However, it is possible to compute an upper bound to such
a cross-correlation.  A simple example demonstrates 
that this information can be the basis of a technique
for structure determination that can make effective 
use of an interactive graphics system. Model building
by cross-correlations has intrinsic advantages 
over usual crystallographic techniques based on the
autocorrelation or Patterson function, especially 
for large structures.  This is significant, for crystallography
of biological macromolecules hasbeen 
and will continue to be a field of intense interest.

Faster Retrieval from Context Trees (Corrigendum)

Context trees provide a convenient way of
storing data which is to be viewed as a hierarchy 
of contexts.  This note presents an algorithm which improves
on previous context tree retrieval algorithms. 
It is based on the observation that in typical uses context
changes are infrequent relative to retrievals, 
so that data can be cached to speed up retrieval.  A retrieval
is started from the position of the previous 
retrieval and auxiliary structures are built up to make
the search rapid.  Algorithms for addition and 
deletion of data and for garbage collection are outlined.
