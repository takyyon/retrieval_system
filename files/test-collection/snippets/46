Compressed Tries

This paper presents a new data structure,
called a compressed trie or C-trie, to be used in 
information retrieval systems.  It has the same underlying
m-ary tree structure as a trie, where m is 
a parameter of the trie, but whereas the fields of the
nodes in a trie have to be large enough to hold 
a key or at least a pointer, the fields in a C-trie are
only one bit long.  In the analysis part of the 
paper it will be shown that for a collection of n keys the
retrieval time, measured in terms of bit inspections 
of one key, is of the order logm(n) and the storage
requirement of the order n*(m+log2 n) bits.  This 
improvement in storage requirements and retrieval time
is achieved at the cost of decreasing the flexibility 
of the structure, and therefore updating costs are increased.
 First the C-trie is analyzed as a data 
structure, and then several methods of its use
for relatively static databases are discussed.

Ambiguity in Limited Entry Decision Tables

The use of decision tables as a tool in systems
analysis and for program specification is now 
becoming accepted.  Rules on redundancy, contradiction,
and completeness for limited entry tables were 
published in 1963.  These are usually used for checking,
preceded if necessary by a conversion from extended 
to limited entry form.  Processors which automatically
translate tables to more conventional program 
usually base their diagnostic facilities on these rules.
 In this paper it is suggested that these rules 
are unsatisfactory and that the important aspect of
checking is to eliminate ambiguity from tables.  
Ambiguity is defined and discussed, and a procedure for
producing checked-out decision tables is proposed. 
 The theoretical basis of the algorithm used is established.
The importance of well-designed diagnostic 
facilities in decision table processors is emphasized.

Experimental Evaluation of Information
Retrieval Through a Teletypewriter

Experiments designed to evaluate the capabilities
of mechanized information retrieval systems, 
with emphasis on interactive (man-machine) language and on
some of the mechanical and psychological limitations 
in their design, were conducted at the Moore School information
Systems Laboratory.  The basic assumption 
of the research is that an information retrieval system
that provides for man-machine dialogue at a remote 
inquiry terminal should provide a searcher with many
of the tools which would be available to him were 
he actually performing his search at a library or repository
of documents.  Factors involved in evaluation 
of such a system include ease of use, learning time, and
effectiveness of actual retrieval.  Three experiments 
and the conclusions resulting from them are detailed.

On the Problem of Communicating Complex Information

The nature of the difficulty involved in communicating
mathematical results between scientists 
using a computer based information retrieval system
is examined.  The problem is analyzed in terms of 
psychological and information-processing processes, and
what turns out to be a vicious circle of effects 
is described.  These include ways of augmenting written
natural language by various notational and linguistic 
devices, the exhibition of the structure inherent in the
information we are communicating, and a sophisticated 
interactive system controlled by computer.

Effective Information Retrieval Using Term Accuracy

The performance of information retrieval systems
can be evaluated in a number of different 
ways.  Much of the published evaluation work is based
on measuring the retrieval performance of an average 
user query.  Unfortunately, formal proofs are difficult
to construct for the average case.  In the present 
study, retrieval evaluation is based on optimizing the
performance of a specific user query.  The concept 
of query term accuracy is in troduced as the probability
of occurrence of a query term in the documents 
relevant to that query.  By relating term accuracy
to the frequency of occurrence of the term in the 
documents of a collection it is possible to give formal
proofs of the effectiveness with respect to a 
given user query of a number of automatic indexing systems
that have been used successfully in experimental 
situations.  Among these are inverse document frequency
weighting, thesaurus construction, and phrase 
generation.

Simulation of Radioisotope Scans by Computer

In radioisotope scanning, a field which is assuming
increasing importance in medical diagnosis, 
the scan is a two-dimensional pattern made up of dots.
 Areas of increased source activity are represented 
on the scan by areas of increased dot density.  To study
the output of scanners with various characteristics, 
a program which simulates radioisotope scans has been
written  for a PDP-1 computer with auxiliary disk 
storage and cathode ray tube display.  Past and present
research using the output of the simulator has 
shown the flexibility of the system to be important.
 The structure of this program can be useful in 
the simulation of the output of any quantum-limited system.

Easy English,a Language for Information
Retrieval Through a Remote Typewriter Console

Easy English is a natural command language
designed to simplify communication between man and 
machine through remote typewriter console.  It has been developed
for retrieval of documents from a computerized 
data base, the Moore School Information Systems Laboratory
files.  Requests are formulated in a standardized 
syntactical form (examples of which are presented), and
this form is then transformed into an equivalent 
query expressed in the retrieval system's original Symbolic
Command Language, which is briefly described. 
 Operation of easy English is detailed by illustration
of the transformations performed upon a sample 
request up to the point at which the request string
is sent to the system.  A macro flowchart of Easy 
English is included, and an Appendix provides
the printout of a retrieval demonstration.

On the Expected Gain From Adjust ing Matched Term Retrieval Systems

A file adjustment procedure based on maximizing
the Bayes expected gain proposed for matched 
term retrieval systems.  The expected gain and its probability
distribution are derived as a function 
of: (1) the prior proportion of omitted terms, and (2) the
coefficient of separation between two distributions 
corresponding to values of an adjustment statistic.  An
example evaluates the gain parameters for a typical 
information retrieval system.

A Simple Proof of Lewin's Ordered-Retrieval
Theorem for Associative Memories

An efficient method of ordered retrieval of binary
words from an associative memory, as described
by Lewin, is based on the use of special readout circuits
which indicate the digit values present in 
the individual digit columns of the memory.  Thus the
circuits indicate whether the individual digit 
columns contain digits of both values, or of only one
value, or contain no digits at all (i.e. that the 
memory is empty).  The use of these circuits, which
in this paper are termed column value indicators, 
reduces considerably the number of memory accesses necessary
to retrieve in order a number of distinct 
words from the memory.  Lewin proves that, for the readout
by the described method of m distinct binary 
words, 2m - 1 memory accesses are necessary.  (Thus he
proves that the number of necessary memory accesses 
of his method, unlike those of other methods, is independent
of the word length.)  In this paper a very 
simple proof of this theorem derived from some elementary
aspects of the structure of sets of binary 
numbers is presented.
