Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System

The concept of one event happening before
another in a distributed system is examined, and
is shown to define a partial ordering of the events.
 A distributed algorithm is given for synchronizing 
a system of logical clocks which can be used to totally
order the events.  The use of the total ordering 
is illustrated with a method for solving synchronization
problems.  The algorithm is then specialized 
for synchronizing physical clocks, and a bound is derived
on how far out of synchrony the clocks can 
become.

Language Analysis in the Humanities

The use of the computer in the language-oriented
humanities for exhaustive listing of detail 
(as in indices and concordances) is widespread and accepted
as desirable.  The implications of the computer 
for a "science" of the humanities-a science entailing
gathering data for the construction and testing 
of models-are neither widely recognized nor accepted.
 This paper argues that the computer's  major role 
as to language analysis in the humanities will be the
establishing of such a sciencehus, for those 
areas of the humanities for which rigor and precision
are necessary (e.g. analyzing literature or teaching 
a student to write a composition) the computer
can be a critically important facilitator.

A Note on Information Organization and Storage

Since the logical structure of a data base
can be represented by a tree or graph, it is quite 
natural for us to view the process of designing a data
base as that of constructing a tree or a graph. 
 A general method for constructing such a tree or a graph
is provided.  There are three important elements 
in this general construction method; namely, a set of
binary relations, an algorithm for constructing 
subsets of a set, and an algorithm for selecting an
element from the given set of objects.  The use of 
different relations and algorithms results in different
information structures, as list, tree, ring, 
etc.  Thus the problem of information organization and
storage is reduced to that of defining relations 
and formulating algorithms under a given set of constraints.
 The results presented may be valuable to 
designers as useful design concepts, and may serve as
a basis for developing a formal theory on the subject.

DAD, The C. Operating System

The design and implementation of the C.
operating system, DAD, is described in detail. 
 This system is designed for the Control Data 3600 using
a large drum backing store and is intended to 
allow the integration of a remote console (display) subsystem
into a conventional job stack environment. 
 The use of the drums, the buffering of input and output
on slow peripherals, and the execution of normal 
job stack work are described.  The display subsystem
is described only as it integrates into the rest 
of the system.  The techniques found useful in the development
of DAD are given, and an assessment is 
made of the validity of various design decisions.  Performance
figures based on several months of operation 
are tabulated.
