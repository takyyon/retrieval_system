A Model for Verification of Data Security in Operating Systems

Program verification applied to kernel architectures
forms a promising method for providing 
uncircumventably secure, shared computer systems.  A
precise definition of data security is developed 
here in terms of a general model for operating systems.
 This model is suitable as a basis for verifying 
many of those properties of an operating system which
are necessary to assure reliable enforcement of 
security.  The application of this approach to the
UCLA secure operating system is also discussed.

BLNSYS-A 1401 Operating System with Braille Capabilities

BLNSYS is an operating system designed for
a 4K 1401 with common optional features and two 
attached tape drives.  Printed output of this system
or of executing programs may be in either English 
or braille.  Even though this system was written for
a small machine with minimal peripheral equipment, 
jobs may be batched, so that card handling and lost
processing time is at a minimum.  This system will 
perform any or all of the following users specified
functions: assemble SPS source decks, post list, 
produce condensed or uncondensed object decks, execute
user's program, list card input to a program, 
list punched output, provide a storage dump, execute
a program submitted for execution as an uncondensed 
object deck under debugging trace control, card-to-braille
conversion, brailled listings of 7040 IBSYS 
batch output, and update or duplicate the system tape
itself.  Input-ouput subroutines are also included 
in the system.

Dynamic Verification of Operating System Decisions

Dynamic verification of a decision implies
that every time the decision is made there is a 
consistency check performed on the decision using independent
hardware and software.  The dynamic verification 
of operating system decisions is used on the PRIME system
being designed and constructed at the University 
of California, Berkeley.  PRIME is an experimental time-sharing
which is to have the properties of continuous 
availability, data privacy, and cost effectiveness.
 The technique of dynamic verification allows the 
construction of an operating system which does not make certain
decisions improperly even in the presence 
of a single hardware or software fault.  Furthermore,
multiple faults lead to unreliable operation only 
if the faults happen to reinforce each other.  On PRIME,
dynamic verification is used to ensure that 
one user's information cannot become available to another
user gratuitously even in the presence of a 
single hardware or software fault.the amount of additional
hardware and software required for dynamic 
verification can be modest.

Operating System Performance

An overview of the current and future positions
with respect to operating system performance 
is given.  While a great deal of information and a large
number of models for subsystems have been developed, 
gaps still exist in out knowledge.  Because of the
severe interactions between the various subsystems 
of an operating system, an overall model of the total
system must be developed to be able to analyze 
and design the performance aspects of an operating system
although such total system designs are exceptional 
today, it is projected that they will become increasingly
more common and necessary in the near future. 
 Such a design philosophy will clearly have a severe impact
on the way we go about modularizing operating 
and computer systems.

On the Meaning of Names in Programming Systems

It is assumed that there is a similarity of
function between the data names of a programming 
language and the file names of an operating system.
 The two functions are discussed in terms of the 
same basic concepts in order to identify the extent
to which they overlap. It is suggested that there 
is some similarity between the idea of a file directory
and a storable object of type context.  Manipulations 
with contexts are then discussed at length.  It is noted
that there is a simple extension of Church's 
Lambda notation that deals nicely with these ideas of
context manipulation.  Whereas a function can be 
regarded as the abstraction based upon the first two terms of
the expression Lambda(name list)(expression)(value list), 
it is found that a context can be viewed as an abstraction
based upon the first two terms in the equivalent 
expression Mu(name list)(value list)(expression).

A Model for a Multifunctional Teaching System

A teaching system model that was incorporated
into an operating system of a large computer 
is described.  The model transferred control to the
operating system to execute functions other than 
teaching, and then recovered control in order to resume
teaching.  The teaching system (ABAC-II) was 
written to run under the operating system (IBSYS) for
the IBM 7044 Graphic System.  Because the teaching 
system automatically terminated and rescheduled itself,
a student studying a course presented at a cathode-ray 
display terminal could switch readily between student
mode and programmer mode.  During the latter, the 
full resources of the operating system (language processors,
compilers, library and user's programs) 
were at his disposal.  He could for example, write, assemble,
debug, and execute at the terminal a program 
written in any language processed by the operating system.
 A course could therefore include text material 
interleaved with programming problems which the student
could solve without leaving the terminal.  Exercises 
in simulation and gaming could also be provided.  The
implications of a teaching system with this degree 
of flexibility for industrial and executive training
as well as academic education are discussed.  In 
addition, the advantages of this type of system for computer
programming and operation are also considered.

Description of a High Capacity, Fast
Turnaround University Computing Center

The operating system for the UNIVAC 1107 at Case
Institute is reviewed.  The system is of interest 
because of the low turnaround times achieved, the high
throughput achieved and the lack of an operating 
staff.  Turnaround times below 5 minutes and job volume
above 75,000 per quarter year one reported.

Telecommunications Using a Front-End Minicomputer

The use of a front-end minicomputer to provide
varied remote terminal access to a large scale 
computer is considered.  The problems of embedding
telecommunications I/O within an operating system 
are discussed, and it is shown how the decentralization
of intelligence acquired by front-end processing 
vastly simplifies the problem.  A specific implementation is
discussed with emphasis on the main processor-minicomputer 
link, the hardware-software implementation, the effect
of the main processor operating system, and an 
assessment of the advantages over a hard wired line controller.

HYDRA: The Kernel of a Multiprocessor Operating System

This paper describes the design philosophy of
HYDRA-the kernel of an operating system for C.mmp, 
the Carnegie-Mellon Multi-Mini-Processor.  This philosophy
is realized through the introduction of a 
generalized notion of "resource", both physical and virtual,
called an "object".  Mechanisms are presented 
for dealing with objects, including the creation of new
types, specification of new operations applicable 
to a given type, sharing, and protection of any reference
to a given object against improper application 
of any of the operations defined with respect to that
type of object.  The mechanisms provide a coherent 
basis for extension of the system in two directions: the
introduction of new facilities, and the creation 
of highly secure systems.

The UNIX Time-Sharing system 

UNIX is a general-purpose, multi-user, interactive
operating system for the Digital Equipment 
Corporation PDP-11/40 and 11/45 computers.  It offers
a number of features seldom found even in larger 
operating systems, including: (1) a hierarchical file system
incorporating demountable volumes; (2) compatible 
file, device, and inter-process I/O; (3) the ability to
initiate asynchronous processes; (4) system command 
language selectable on a per-user basis; and (5) over
100 subsystems including a dozen languageshis 
paper discusses the nature and implementation of the
file system and of the user command interface.
