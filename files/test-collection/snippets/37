Snippets for the query:  What is the type of a module? (I don't want the entire literature on Abstract Data Types here, but I'm not sure how to phrase this to avoid it. I'm interested in questions about how one can check that a module "matches" contexts in which it is used.)

Abstract Data Types and the Development of Data Structures

Abstract data types can play a significant role
in the development of software that is reliable, 
efficient, and flexible.  This paper presents and discusses
the application of an algebraic technique 
for the specification of abstract data types.  Among
the examples presented is a top-down development 
of a symbol table for a block structured language; a discussion
of the proof of its correctness is given. 
 The paper also contains a brief discussion of the problems
involved in constructing algebraic specifications 
that are both consistent and complete.

Storage and Retrieval of Aspects of Meaning in Directed Graph Structures

An experimental system that uses LISP to make
a conceptual dictionary is described.  The dictionary 
associates with each English word the syntactic information,
definitional material, and references to 
the contexts in which it has been used to define other words.
 Such relations as class inclusion, possession, 
and active or passive actions are used as definitional
material.  The resulting structure serves as a 
powerful vehicle for research on the logic of question answering.
 Examples of methods of inputting information 
and answering simple English questions are given.  An
important conclusion is that, although LISP and 
other list processing languages are ideally suited for
producing complex associative structures, they 
are inadequate vehicles for language processing on any
large scale-at east until they can use auxiliary 
memory as a continuous extension of core memory.

Abstract Data Types and Software Validation

A data abstraction can be naturally specified
using algebraic axioms.  The virtue of these 
axioms is that they permit a representation-independent
formal specification of a data type.  An example 
is given which shows how to employ algebraic axioms at
successive levels of implementation.  The  major 
thrust of the paper is twofold.  First, it is shown how
the use of algebraic axiomatizations can simplify 
the process of proving the correctness of an implementation
of an abstract data type.  Second, semi-automatic 
tools are described which can be used both to automate
such proofs of correctness and to derive an immediate 
implementation from the axioms.  This implementation
allows for limited testing of programs at design 
time, before a conventional implementation is accomplished.

An Application of FORMAC

A nonlinear circuit analysis problem is stated
and the way in which it was solved using FORMAC 
is indicated.  The solution of the problem using FORMAC
was notable since several other methods that 
were tried failed.  The problem is straightforward (although
untenable by hand) but nevertheless involved 
an elaborate use of the FORMAC language.  The program
was fairly large and utilized practically every 
command.  In particular, it made extensive use of the
PART command.  Several tricks were necessary in 
order to circumvent some of the shortcomings of the
FORMAC system.  This paper is more concerned with 
the use of programming techniques in FORMAC than with
the actual engineering problem, although readers 
may be interested in the problem because it is stated
in a general (mathematical) sense and could be 
of interest in areas other than circuit analysis.

A Statistical Model for Console Behavior in Multiuser Computers

The ability of a computer system to communicate
with the outside world efficiently is as important 
as its ability to perform computations efficiently. 
It is quite difficult to characterize a particular 
user, but rather easy to characterize the entire user community.
 Based on the properties of this community 
we have postulated a hypothetical "virtual console."
 No claim is made that a virtual console behaves 
like any actual console, but the entire collection of
virtual consoles models the collection of actual 
consoles.  Using the model we answer questions like: 
How many processes are suspended waiting for console 
input?  What is the maximum rate at which a process can
execute?  What bounds can be set on overall buffer 
requirements?  Answers to these and similar questions
are needed in certain aspects of operating system 
design.
