Snippets for the query:  What does type compatibility mean in languages that allow programmer defined types? (You might want to restrict this to "extensible" languages that allow definition of abstract data types or programmer-supplied definitions of operators like *, +.)

Abstract Data Types and the Development of Data Structures

Abstract <B>data types</B> can play a significant role
in the development of software that is reliable, 
efficient, and flexible.  This paper presents and discusses
the application of an algebraic technique 
for the specification of abstract data types.  Among
the examples presented is a top-down development 
of a symbol table for a block structured language; a discussion
of the proof of its correctness is given. 
 The paper also contains a brief discussion of the problems
involved in constructing algebraic specifications 
that are both consistent and complete.

A Proposal for Definitions in ALGOL

An extension to ALGOL is proposed for adding
new <B>data types</B> and operators to the language. 
 Definitions may occur in any block heading and terminate
with the block.  They are an integral part 
of the program and are not fixed in the language.  Even
the behavior of existing operators may be redefined. 
 The processing of text containing defined contexts features
a "replacement rule" that eliminates unnecessary 
iterations and temporary storage.  Examples of definition sets
are given for real and complex matrices, 
complex numbers, file processing, and list manipulation.

Derived Semantics for Some Programming Language Constructs

The constructs of a simple programming language
are introduced and described informally in 
terms of values and side-effects.  A translator is defined
which translates the language into flowcharts 
for a simple machine.  The action of the machine in executing
a flowchart is defined.  A proof is constructed 
that the effect of translating and executing any program
can be expressed solely in terms of the value 
and side-effect of the program.  During the course of
constructing the proof, formal <B>definitions of</B> the 
concepts of value and side-effect are derived in order
to make the proof rigorous.  Correctness of the 
implementation involves checking that the definitions derived
in the step above are an acceptable formalization 
of the informal description given in the first step.

Abstract Data Types and Software Validation

A data abstraction can be naturally specified
using algebraic axioms.  The virtue of these 
axioms is that they permit a representation-independent
formal specification of a data type.  An example 
is given which shows how to employ algebraic axioms at
successive levels of implementation.  The  major 
thrust of the paper is twofold.  First, it is shown how
the use of algebraic axiomatizations can simplify 
the process of proving the correctness of an implementation
of an <B>abstract data</B> type.  Second, semi-automatic 
tools are described which can be used both to automate
such proofs of correctness and to derive an immediate 
implementation from the axioms.  This implementation
allows for limited testing of programs at design 
time, before a conventional implementation is accomplished.

Abstraction and Verification in Alphard: Defining
and Specifying Iteration and Generators

The Alphard "form" provides the programmer with
a great deal of control over the implementation 
<B>of abstract</B> data types.  In this paper the abstraction techniques
are extended from simple data representation 
and function definition to the iteration statement, the
most important poin t of interaction between data 
and the control structure of the language itself.  A
means of specializing Alphard's loops to operate 
on abstract entities without explicit dependence on the
representation of those entities is in troduced. 
 Specification and verification techniques that allow
the properties of the generators for such iterations 
to be expressed in the form of proof rules are developed.
 Results are obtained that for common special 
cases of these loops are essentially identical to the
corresponding constructs in other languages.  A 
means of showing that a generator will terminate is also provided.

Logic and Programming Languages

Logic has been long in terested in whether answers
to certain questions are computable in principle, 
since the outcome puts bounds on the possibilities of
formalization.  More recently, precise comparisons 
in the efficiency of decision methods have become available
through the developments in complexity theory. 
 These, however, are applications to logic, and a big question
is whether methods of logic have significance 
in the other direction for the more applied parts of
computability theory.  Programming languages offer 
an obvious opportunity as their syntactic formalization
is well advanced; however, the semantical theory 
can hardly be said to be complete.  Though we have
many examples, we have still to give wide-ranging 
mathematical answers to these queries:  What is a machine?
 What is a computable process?  How (or how 
well) does a machine simulate a process?  Programs naturally
enter in giving descriptions of processes. 
 The <B>definition of</B> the precise meaning of a program
then requires us to explain what are the objects 
of computation (in a way, the statics of the problem)
and how they are to be transformed (the dynamics). 
 So far the theories of automata and of nets, though
most in teresting for dynamics, have formalized only 
a portion of the field, and there has been perhaps too
much concentration on the finite-state and algebraic 
aspects.  It would seem that the understanding of higher-level
program features involves us with infinite 
objects and forces us to pass through several levels
of explanation to go from the conceptual ideas to 
the final simulation on a real machine.  These levels
can be made mathematically exact if we can find 
the right abstractions to represent the necessary structures.
 The experience of many independent workers 
with the method of data types as lattices (or partial
orderings) under an information content ordering, 
and with their continuous mappings, has demonstrated the
flexibility of this approach in providing definitions 
and proofs, which are clean and without undue dependence
on implementations.  Nevertheless much remains 
to be done in showing how abstract conceptualizations
can (or cannot) be actualized before we can say 
we have a unified theory.

then requires us to explain what are the objects 
of computation (in a way, the statics of the problem)
and how they are to be transformed (the dynamics). 
 So far the theories of automata and of nets, though
most in teresting for dynamics, have formalized only 
a portion of the field, and there has been perhaps too
much concentration on the finite-state and algebraic 
aspects.  It would seem that the understanding of higher-level
program features involves us with infinite 
objects and forces us to pass through several levels
of explanation to go from the conceptual ideas to 
the final simulation on a real machine.  These levels
can be made mathematically exact if we can find 
the right abstractions to represent the necessary structures.
 The experience of many independent workers 
with the method of <B>data types</B> as lattices (or partial
orderings) under an information content ordering, 
and with their continuous mappings, has demonstrated the
flexibility of this approach in providing definitions 
and proofs, which are clean and without undue dependence
on implementations.  Nevertheless much remains 
to be done in showing how abstract conceptualizations
can (or cannot) be actualized before we can say 
we have a unified theory.

Automatic Data Structure Selection: An Example and Overview

The use of several levels of abstraction has
proved to be very helpful in constructing and 
maintaining programs.  When programs are designed with abstract
<B>data types</B> such as sets and lists, programmer 
time can be saved by automating the process of filling
in low-level implementation details.  In the past, 
programming systems have provided only a single general
purpose implementation for an abstract type. 
 Thus the programs produced using abstract types were
then inefficient in space or time.  In this paper 
a system for automatically choosing efficient implementations
for abstract types from a library of implementations 
is discussed.  This process is discussed in detail for
an example program.  General issues in data structure 
selection are also reviewed.

Semantic Evaluation from Left to Right

This paper describes attribute grammars and their
use for the <B>definition of</B> programming languages 
and compilers; a formal definition of attribute grammars
and a discussion of some of its important aspects 
are included. The paper concentrates on the evaluation
of semantic attributes in a few passes from left 
to right over the derivation tree of a program.  A
condition for an attribute grammar is given which 
assures that the semantics of any program can be evaluated
in a single pass over the derivation tree, 
and an algorithm is discussed which decides how many
passes from left to right are in general necessary, 
given the attribute grammar. These notions are explained
in terms of an example grammar which describes 
the scope rules of Algol 60.  Practical questions, such
as the relative efficiency of different evaluation 
schemes, and the ease of adapting the attribute grammar
of a given programming language to the left-to-right 
evaluation scheme are discussed.

A Language Extension for Expressing Constraints on Data Access

Controlled sharing of information is needed and
desirable for many applications and is supported 
in operating systems by access control mechanisms.  This
paper shows how to extend programming languages 
to provide controlled sharing.  The extension permits
expression of access constraints on shared data. 
 Access constraints can apply both to simple objects, and
to objects that are components of larger objects, 
such as bank account records in a bank's data base.
 The constraints are stated declaratively, and can 
be enforced by static checking similar to type checking.
 The approach can be used to extend any strongly-typed 
language, but is particularly suitable for extending
<B>languages that</B> support the notion of abstract data 
types.

Problems involving the arrangement of objects in two-

of derivatives of the distance between objects or their arrangement
are called space planning problems.  The representational

Some Ideas on Data Types in High-Level Languages

A number of issues are explored concerning the
notion that a data type is a set of values together 
with a set of primitive operations on those values.  Among
these are the need for a notation for iterating 
over the elements of any finite set (instead of the
more narrow for i:= 1 to n notation), the use of 
the domain of an array as a data type, the need for
a simple notation for allowing types of parameters 
to be themselves parameters (but in a restrictive fashion),
and resulting problems with conversion of 
values from one type to another.

Fen-An Axiomatic Basis for Program Semantics

A formal system is presented which abstracts
the notions of data item, function, and relation. 
 It is argued that the system is more suitable than set
theory (or its derivatives) for the concise and 
accurate description of program semantics.  It is shown
how the system can be used to build composite 
<B>data types</B> out of simper ones with the operations of rowing,
structuring, and uniting.  It is also demonstrated 
that completely new primitive types can be introduced
into languages through the mechanism of singleton 
data types.  Both deterministic and nondeterministic
functions are shown to be definable in the system. 
 It is described how the local environment can be modeled
as a data item and how imperative statements 
can be considered functions on the environment.  The
nature of recursive functions is briefly discussed, 
and a technique is presented by which they can be introduced
into the system.  The technique is contrasted 
with the use of the paradoxical combinator, Y.  The
questions of local and global environments and of 
various modes of function calling and parameter passing
are touched upon. The theory is applied to the 
proof of several elementary theorems concerning the semantics
of the assignment, conditional, and iterative 
statements.  An appendix is included which presents in
detail the formal system governing webs and fen, 
the abstractions used informally in the body of the paper.

BLISS: A Language for Systems Programming

A language, BLISS, is described.  This language
is designed so as to be especially suitable 
for use in writing production software systems for a
specific machine (the PDP-10): compilers, operating 
systems, etc.  Prime design goals of the design are the
ability to produce highly efficient object code, 
to allow access to all relevant hardware features of
the host machine, and to provide a rational means 
by which to cope with the evolutionary nature of systems
programs.  A major feature which contributes 
to the realization of these goals is a mechanism permitting
the <B>definition of</B> the representation of all 
data structures in terms of the access algorithm for elements of the structure.

The Description List of Concepts

A concept is defined as a class of objects
whose members can be distinguished by processing 
its properties.  Property is defined to mean a partition
of the set of all objects into disjoint classes. 
 The formal <B>definition of</B> a concept is recursive in nature.
 A concept is described by a list structure. 
 A one-to-one correspondence is established between the
recursive definition of a concept and its description 
list structure.  Like the definition, the description
list structure of a concept is also built up from 
elementary list structures by a recursive process.

AXLE: An Axiomatic Language for String Transformations

AXLE is a language designed for data manipulation.
 Data arranged in a linear form in a workspace 
is transformed according to a table of axioms, called imperatives.
 A transformation consists of a matching 
procedure, which decides where an imperative is applicable,
and a replacement procedure that modifies 
that part of the workspace.  Imperatives are applied
in accordance with <B>definitions of</B> symbolic terms, 
presented systematically in an assertion table.  The
process of definition includes the special case 
of recursive assertions.  Several complete programs
of imperatives are given to show a few applications
of the language.

The Treatment of Data Types in EL1

In constructing a general purpose programming
language, a key issue is providing a sufficient 
set of <B>data types</B> and associated operations in a manner
that permits both natural problem-oriented notation 
and efficient implementation.  The EL1 language contains
a number of features specifically designed to 
simultaneously satisfy both requirements.  The resulting
treatment of data types includes provision for 
programmer-defined data types data types and generic
routines, programmer control over type conversion, 
and very flexible data type behavior, in a context that
allows efficient compiled code and compact data 
representation.

A Rapid Method for Digital Filtering

Since much of the computer time spent in time-series
analysis is used for multiplications, 
a minimum multiplication method was devised for digital
filtering, with the expectation that it would 
be useful in the on line, real-time analysis of biological
data.  The filters are constructed from a succession 
of readily analyzable components in a manner that facilitates
cascading.  The repertoire of frequency 
response curves includes relatively good low-pass and
band-pass designs.  Programs are available for 
implementing both the synthesis of these filters, and
their application on computers whose assemblers 
allow the <B>definition of</B> recursive macros.

The SL5 Procedure Mechanism

This paper describes an integrated procedure
mechanism that permits procedures to be used as 
recursive functions or as coroutines.  This integration
is accomplished by treating procedures and their 
activation records (called environments) as data objects
and by decomposing procedure invocation into 
three separate components at the source-language level.
 In addition, argument binding is under the control 
of the programmer, permitting the <B>definition of</B> various
methods of argument transmission in the source 
language itself.  The resulting procedure mechanism,which
is part of the SL5 programming language, is 
well suited to goal-oriented problems and to other problems
that are more readily programmed by using 
coroutines. Several examples are given.

Abstraction Mechanisms in CLU

CLU is a new programming language designed to support
the use of abstractions in program construction. 
 Work in programming methodology has led to the realization
that three kinds of abstractions-procedural, 
control, and especially data abstractions-are useful
in the programming process.  Of these, only the 
procedural abstraction is supported well by conventional
languages, through the procedure or subroutine. 
 CLU provides, in addition to procedures, novel linguistic
mechanisms that support the use of data and 
control abstractions.  This paper provides an in troduction
to the abstraction mechanisms in CLU.  By 
means of programming examples, the utility of the three
kinds of abstractions in program construction 
is illustrated, and it is shown how CLU programs may
be written to use and implement abstractions.  The 
CLU library, which permits incremental program development
with complete type checking performed at compile 
time, is also discussed.

The MAD Definition Facility

One of the first definition facilities for
higher level languages is described.  Users of the 
language can define new operators and/or <B>data types</B>
into the MAD language, so that their use appears 
as if they were predefined.  Information is given on
how one writes definitions, as well as on much of 
the motivation behind the form in which definitions are
written. Some conclusions are drawn about future 
definitional facilities.

A Language Extension for Graph Processing and Its Formal Semantics

A simple programming language "extension,"
Graspe, for processing directed graphs is defined. 
 Graspe consists of a type of directed graph data structure
and a set of primitive operations for manipulating 
these structures.  Graspe may be most easily implemented
by embedding it in a host language.  Emphasis 
is placed both on Graspe itself and on its method of
definition.  Commonly, the <B>definition of</B> a language 
involves definition of the syntactic elements and explanation
of the meaning to be assigned them (the 
semantics).  The definition of Graspe here is solely in
terms of its semantics; that is, the data structures 
and operations are defined precisely but without assignment
of a particular syntactic representation. 
 Only when the language is implemented is assignment
of an explicit syntax necessary.  An example of 
an implementation of Graspe embedded in Lisp is given as
an illustration.  The advantages and disadvantages 
of the definition of a language in terms of its semantics are discussed.

A Model for Type Checking

Most current programming languages treat computation
over different classes of objects (e.g. 
numbers, strings, labels and functions).  For correct
compilation and execution, the following question 
then arises: is a program properly constructed so that
its operations and operands are compatible?  The 
activity of answering this question is usually called
type checking.  This paper attempts to isolate 
the notion of type checking and presents a partial
solution to the type checking problem based on the 
notions <B>of abstract</B>ion and application of functions. 
In particular, a program is mapped into an expression 
within a decidable subset of the Lambda calculus, which
characterizes the type relations within the program 
and eliminates all other information.  The determination
of the type-wise correctness or incorrectness 
of the program is resolved by reducing its corresponding
Lambda calculus expression to one of two normal 
forms, the constant "correct" for a type-wise correct
program or the constant "error".  An application 
to type checking in Algol 60 is made, and the attendant
problems faced for any notion of type checking 
are discussed.

An Experimental Evaluation of Data Type Conventions

The language in which programs are written
can have a substantial effect on the reliability 
of the resulting programs.  This paper discusses an experiment
that compares the programming reliability 
of subjects using a statically typed language and a "typeless"
language.  Analysis of the number of errors 
and the number of runs containing errors shows that, at
least in one environment, the use of a statically 
typed language can increase programming reliability. 
Detailed analysis of the errors made by the subjects 
in programming solutions to reasonably small problems
shows that the subjects had difficulty manipulating 
the representation of data.

A Psychology of Learning BASIC

This paper addresses the question: <B>What does</B> a person know
following learning of BASIC programming?  Several underlying conceptual
structures are identified: (1) a transaction is an event that
occurs in the computer and involves some operation on some object
at some location, (2) a prestatement is a set of transactions corresponding
to a line of code, (3) chunks are frequently occurring
 configurations of prestatements corresponding to several lines of code.

Blocks-A New Data type for SNOBOL4

A new data type, called a block, has been implemented
for SNOBOL4.  A block is a three-dimensional 
aggregate of characters in the form of a right parallelepiped,
best thought of as a three-dimensional 
extension to a string.  (The third dimension is used for
overstriking.)  Blocks may be printed, concatenated 
in any of three dimensions, and merged on the basis
of program-defined connection points.  Some blocks 
adapt in size and shape to their environment.  Blocks
and their operations are mainly used for composing 
printable output.  A variety of graphical problems (including
flowcharting, bargraphs, logic diagrams, 
mathematical-equation formation, and text justification
and preparation) have been programmed on a printer 
in what appears to be an easy and natural way.  In addition
to these somewhat specialized applications, 
blocks appear to be a good general purpose device-independent
output formation mechanism especially suitable 
for nonnumerical work.  The concept of a block is largely
language independenthat is, blocks require 
little in the way of specialized syntax and could readily
be absorbed into the external structure of 
most programming languages.
