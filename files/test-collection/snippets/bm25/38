Snippets for the query:  What does type compatibility mean in languages that allow programmer defined types? (You might want to restrict this to "extensible" languages that allow definition of abstract data types or programmer-supplied definitions of operators like *, +.)

Abstract Data Types and the Development of Data Structures

Abstract data types can play a significant role
in the development of software that is reliable, 
efficient, and flexible.  This paper presents and discusses
the application of an algebraic technique 
for the specification of abstract data types.  Among
the examples presented is a top-down development 
of a symbol table for a block structured language; a discussion
of the proof of its correctness is given. 
 The paper also contains a brief discussion of the problems
involved in constructing algebraic specifications 
that are both consistent and complete.

Abstraction and Verification in Alphard: Defining
and Specifying Iteration and Generators

The Alphard "form" provides the programmer with
a great deal of control over the implementation 
of abstract data types.  In this paper the abstraction techniques
are extended from simple data representation 
and function definition to the iteration statement, the
most important poin t of interaction between data 
and the control structure of the language itself.  A
means of specializing Alphard's loops to operate 
on abstract entities without explicit dependence on the
representation of those entities is in troduced. 
 Specification and verification techniques that allow
the properties of the generators for such iterations 
to be expressed in the form of proof rules are developed.
 Results are obtained that for common special 
cases of these loops are essentially identical to the
corresponding constructs in other languages.  A 
means of showing that a generator will terminate is also provided.

A Language Extension for Expressing Constraints on Data Access

Controlled sharing of information is needed and
desirable for many applications and is supported 
in operating systems by access control mechanisms.  This
paper shows how to extend programming languages 
to provide controlled sharing.  The extension permits
expression of access constraints on shared data. 
 Access constraints can apply both to simple objects, and
to objects that are components of larger objects, 
such as bank account records in a bank's data base.
 The constraints are stated declaratively, and can 
be enforced by static checking similar to type checking.
 The approach can be used to extend any strongly-typed 
language, but is particularly suitable for extending
languages that support the notion of abstract data 
types.
