A System for Typesetting Mathematics

This paper describes the design and implementation
of a system for typesetting mathematics. 
 The language has been designed to be easy to learn
and to use by people (for example, secretaries and 
mathematical typists) who know neither mathematics nor
typesetting.  Experience indicates that the language 
can be learned in an hour or so, for it has few rules
and fewer exceptions.  For typical expressions, 
the size and font changes, positioning, line drawing, and
the like necessary to print according to mathematical 
conventions are all done automatically.  For example,
the input sum from i=o to infinity x sub i=pi over 
2 produces (formula).  The syntax of the language is specified
by a small context-free grammar; a compiler-compiler 
is used to make a compiler that translates this language
into typesetting commands.  Output maybe produced 
on either a phototypesetter or on a terminal with forward
and reverse half-line motions.  The system 
interfaces directly with <B>text formatting</B> programs, so
mixtures of text and mathematics may be handled 
simply.  This paper was typeset by the authors using the system described

When Your Computer Needs a Lawyer

Possible liability for negligence, for other
torts (such as slander of credit) and for liability 
under theories of express or implied warranty (guarantees)
are discussed, and legal complications are 
explained, so that users, operators, owners, and leasors
of computers may be alerted to potential legal 
problems. Focus is also on trouble spots in contracting
for data processing services, in automating record 
keeping operations, in deciding whether or not to automate
certain operations, and in complying with 
statutes and regulation relating to record keeping.
 Information is given on patents, copyrights and 
trade secret protection for programs, and the problem
of using copyrighted material in information storage 
and retrieval <B>systems, including</B> the pending
copyright and patent revision bills.

The UNIX Time-Sharing system 

UNIX is a general-purpose, multi-user, interactive
operating system for the Digital Equipment 
Corporation PDP-11/40 and 11/45 computers.  It offers
a number of features seldom found even in larger 
operating <B>systems, including</B>: (1) a hierarchical file system
incorporating demountable volumes; (2) compatible 
file, device, and inter-process I/O; (3) the ability to
initiate asynchronous processes; (4) system command 
language selectable on a per-user basis; and (5) over
100 subsystems including a dozen languageshis 
paper discusses the nature and implementation of the
file system and of the user command interface.
