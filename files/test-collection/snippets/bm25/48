SITAR: An Interactive Text Processing System for Small Computers

SITAR, a low-cost in teractive text handling
and text analysis system for nontechnical users, 
is in many ways comparable to in teractive bibliographical
search and retrieval systems, but has several 
additional features. It is implemented on a PDP/11 time-sharing
computer invoked by a CRT with microprogrammed 
editing functions.  It uses a simple command language designating
a function, a file, and a search template 
consisting of the textual string desired and strings
delimiting the context in which the hit is to be 
delivered.  Extensive experience with SITAR shows that
the combined powers of simple commands, string 
orientation, circular file structure, a CRT with local
memory, and conversational computing produce a 
system much more powerful than the sum of its parts.

Everyman's Information Retrieval System

The <B>information retrieval</B> problem whose solution
is presented here was posed by a technical 
library with limited bubget and personnel.  The solution,
however, is quite general and is applicable 
to many different types of retrieval problems.  Further,the
method of solution makes it possible for 
many groups who have previously dismissed an information
retrieval program as expensive and difficult 
(from a programming stand-point) to reconsider their position,
for the present solution makes it possible 
to install an information retrieval program in less than
three months, and with relatively little equipment.

A Computer Center Simulation Project

Today's computation centers are based on rapidly
changing technologies of hardware and software 
systems.  It is difficult, therefore, to base decisions
on experience; in most instances, the benefits 
of comparable experience for a given problem situation
are not available.  In this paper, a mathematical 
model of the Lockheed Central Computer Center is formulated
that describes the operation of a computation 
center in terms <B>of information</B> nets, decision processes,
and control functions.  Experiments performed 
with this model, the results of the experiments,
and the application of the results are discussed.

Dynamic Document Processing

The current role of computers in automatic
document processing is briefly outlined, and some 
reasons are given why the early promise of library automation
and of the mechanization of documentation 
processes has not been fulfilled.  A new dynamic document
environment is then outlined in which clustered
files are searched and information is retrieved following
an interactive user-controlled search process. 
 Methods are described for an automatic query modification
based on user needs, and for a continuous 
reorganization of the stored information as a function of
earlier file processing and of normal collection 
growth.  The proposed procedures provide powerful tools
for <B>information retrieval</B> and for the control 
of dynamic library collections in which new items
are continually added and old ones are retired.

Design of Tree Structures for Efficient Querying

A standard <B>information retrieval</B> operation is
to determine which records in a data collection 
satisfy a given query expressed in terms of data values.
 The process of locating the desired responses 
can be represented by a tree search model.  This paper
poses an optimization problem in the design of 
such trees to serve a well-specified application. The
problem is academic in the sense that ordinarily 
the optimal tree cannot be implemented by means of practical
techniques.  On the other hand, it is potentially 
useful for the comparison it affords between observed
performance and that of an intuitively attractive 
ideal search procedure.  As a practical application
of such a model this paper considers the design of 
a novel tree search scheme based on a bit vector representation
of data and shows that essentially the 
same algorithm can be used to design either an ideal
search tree or a bit-vector tree.  An experimental 
study of a small formatted file illustrates the concepts.

Compressed Tries

This paper presents a new data structure,
called a compressed trie or C-trie, to be used in 
<B>information retrieval</B> systems.  It has the same underlying
m-ary tree structure as a trie, where m is 
a parameter of the trie, but whereas the fields of the
nodes in a trie have to be large enough to hold 
a key or at least a pointer, the fields in a C-trie are
only one bit long.  In the analysis part of the 
paper it will be shown that for a collection of n keys the
retrieval time, measured in terms of bit inspections 
of one key, is of the order logm(n) and the storage
requirement of the order n*(m+log2 n) bits.  This 
improvement in storage requirements and retrieval time
is achieved at the cost of decreasing the flexibility 
of the structure, and therefore updating costs are increased.
 First the C-trie is analyzed as a data 
structure, and then several methods of its use
for relatively static databases are discussed.

Hierarchical Storage in Information Retrieval

A probabilistic analysis is employed to determine
the effect of hierarchical storage organizations 
on <B>information retrieval</B> operations.  The data storage
hardware is assumed to consist on n-levels of 
linearly connected memory hardware with increasing data
access times and increasing data storage capabilities. 
 A system might, for example, consist of fast semiconductor
memory, computer core memory, extended core 
storage, disk memory, and data cells.  Equations are derived
to predict the effect of such a system on 
data access times using sequential files, random access files,
and structured files employing multiple-hierarchical 
linked lists.

A Note on Information Organization and Storage

Since the logical structure of a data base
can be represented by a tree or graph, it is quite 
natural for us to view the process of designing a data
base as that of constructing a tree or a graph. 
 A general method for constructing such a tree or a graph
is provided.  There are three important elements 
in this general construction method; namely, a set of
binary relations, an algorithm for constructing 
subsets of a set, and an algorithm for selecting an
element from the given set of objects.  The use of 
different relations and algorithms results in different
information structures, as list, tree, ring, 
etc.  Thus the problem of information organization and
storage is reduced to that of defining relations 
and formulating algorithms under a given set of constraints.
 The results presented may be valuable to 
designers as useful design concepts, and may serve as
a basis for developing a formal theory on the subject.

An Information-Theoretic Approach to
Text Searching in Direct Access Systems

Using direct access computer files of bibliographic
information, an attempt is made to overcome 
one of the problems often associated with information
retrieval, namely, the maintenance and use of large 
dictionaries, the greater part of which is used only
infrequently.  A novel method is presented, which 
maps the hyperbolic frequency distribution.  This is
more suited to implementation on storage devices. 
 This method treats text as a string of characters rather
than words bounded by spaces, and chooses subsets 
of strings such that their frequencies of occurrence are
more even than those of word types.  The members 
of this subset are then used as index keys for retrieval.
The rectangular distribution of key frequencies 
results in a much simplified file organization
and promises considerable cost advantages.

psychological and information-processing processes, and
what turns out to be a vicious circle of effects

Retrieval-Update Speed Tradeoffs Using Combined Indices

In a paper in the November 1970 Communications
of the ACM, V. Y. Lum introduced a technique 
of file indexing named combined indices.  This technique
permitted decreased retrieval time at the cost 
of increased storage space.  This paper examines combined
indices under conditions of file usage with 
different fractions of retrieval and update.  Tradeoff
curves are developed to show minimal cost of file 
usage by grouping various partially combined indices.

Easy English,a Language for Information
Retrieval Through a Remote Typewriter Console

Easy English is a natural command language
designed to simplify communication between man and 
machine through remote typewriter console.  It has been developed
for retrieval of documents from a computerized 
data base, the Moore School Information Systems Laboratory
files.  Requests are formulated in a standardized 
syntactical form (examples of which are presented), and
this form is then transformed into an equivalent 
query expressed in the retrieval system's original Symbolic
Command Language, which is briefly described. 
 Operation of easy English is detailed by illustration

On the Expected Gain From Adjust ing Matched Term Retrieval Systems

A file adjustment procedure based on maximizing
the Bayes expected gain proposed for matched 
term retrieval systems.  The expected gain and its probability
distribution are derived as a function 
of: (1) the prior proportion of omitted terms, and (2) the
coefficient of separation between two distributions 
corresponding to values of an adjustment statistic.  An
example evaluates the gain parameters for a typical

A Simple Proof of Lewin's Ordered-Retrieval
Theorem for Associative Memories

An efficient method of ordered retrieval of binary
words from an associative memory, as described
by Lewin, is based on the use of special readout circuits
which indicate the digit values present in 
the individual digit columns of the memory.  Thus the
circuits indicate whether the individual digit 
columns contain digits of both values, or of only one
value, or contain no digits at all (i.e. that the 
memory is empty).  The use of these circuits, which
in this paper are termed column value indicators, 
reduces considerably the number of memory accesses necessary
to retrieve in order a number of distinct 
words from the memory.  Lewin proves that, for the readout
by the described method of m distinct binary 
words, 2m - 1 memory accesses are necessary.  (Thus he
proves that the number of necessary memory accesses 
of his method, unlike those of other methods, is independent
of the word length.)  In this paper a very 
simple proof of this theorem derived from some elementary
aspects of the structure of sets of binary 
numbers is presented.

A Stochastic Evaluation Model for Database
Organization in Data Retrieval Systems

Experimental work in the valuation of large
scale data retrieval systems has been scarce due 
to its difficulty and prohibitive cost. This paper
discusses a simulation model of a data retrieval 
system which has the effect of significantly reducing
the cost of experimentation and enabling research 
never attempted before.  The model is designed to estimate
the retrieval workload of alternative data 
retrieval systems.  These data retrieval systems can
be organized under several database organizations, 
including inverted list, threaded list, and cellular
list organizations and hybrid combinations of these 
systems.  Effectiveness of the methodology is demonstrated
by using the model to study the effect of 
database organizations in data retrieval systems.  In particular,
the impact of query complexity is analyzed.

Experimental Evaluation of Information
Retrieval Through a Teletypewriter

Experiments designed to evaluate the capabilities
of mechanized <B>information retrieval</B> systems, 
with emphasis on interactive (man-machine) language and on
some of the mechanical and psychological limitations 
in their design, were conducted at the Moore School information
Systems Laboratory.  The basic assumption 
of the research is that an information retrieval system
that provides for man-machine dialogue at a remote 
inquiry terminal should provide a searcher with many
of the tools which would be available to him were 
he actually performing his search at a library or repository
of documents.  Factors involved in evaluation 
of such a system include ease of use, learning time, and
effectiveness of actual retrieval.  Three experiments 
and the conclusions resulting from them are detailed.

Effects of Chargeout on User/Manager Attitudes

The relationship of in ternal pricing systems
for computer services (chargeout systems) and 
user management attitudes about their computer-based
information systems is investigated. Evidence is 
provided that the relationship conforms to a general
pattern that would be expected from the hypothesis 
of the four stages of EDP growth [15].  The results also
indicate that the chargeout systems characteristic 
of advanced EDP stage environments are associated with
relatively high levels of positive user attitudes 
and marked increases in EDP training for users. Both factors
are important to the user/manager involvement 
necessary for effective control of computer-<B>based systems</B>.
 Development and main tenance of computer-based 
systems is asserted to be a category of organizational
change.  A "felt need" for the change on the part 
of the user/manager is prerequisite to any change taking
place.  The research methods of behavioral science 
are applied to investigate the user/manager
environment and the effects of chargeout.

Canonical Structure in Attribute Based File Organization

A new file structure for attribute based retrieval
is proposed in this paper.  It allows queries 
involving arbitrary Boolean functions of the attribute-value
pairs to be processed without taking intersections 
of lists.  The structure is highly dependent on the
way in which the file is to be used and is uniquely 
determined by the specification of the allowed queries.
 Thus, for example, the structure for retrieval 
on the basis of ranges of values of a given attribute would
be very different from one where only retrieval 
on the basis of a single value is permitted.  The file
organization being proposed is based on the atoms 
of a Boolean algebra generated by the queries.  The desirable
properties claimed for this structure are 
proved, and file maintenance questions are discussed.

Effective Information Retrieval Using Term Accuracy

The performance <B>of information</B> retrieval systems
can be evaluated in a number of different 
ways.  Much of the published evaluation work is based
on measuring the retrieval performance of an average 
user query.  Unfortunately, formal proofs are difficult
to construct for the average case.  In the present 
study, retrieval evaluation is based on optimizing the
performance of a specific user query.  The concept 
of query term accuracy is in troduced as the probability
of occurrence of a query term in the documents 
relevant to that query.  By relating term accuracy
to the frequency of occurrence of the term in the 
documents of a collection it is possible to give formal
proofs of the effectiveness with respect to a 
given user query of a number of automatic indexing systems
that have been used successfully in experimental 
situations.  Among these are inverse document frequency
weighting, thesaurus construction, and phrase

Sentence Paraphrasing from a Conceptual Base

A model of natural language based on an underlying
language-free representation of meaning 
is described.  A program based on this model is able
to produce sentence paraphrases which demonstrate 
understanding with respect to a given context.  This
generator operates in conjunction with a natural 
language analyzer and a combined memory and inference model.
 In generating sentences from meaning structures, 
the program employs both the <B>information retrieval</B> and
deduction capabilities of the memory model.  The 
model encompasses several diverse classes of linguistic
knowledge, which include: (1) executable tests 
of conceptual properties stored in discrimination nets;
(2) information relating conceptual to syntactic 
roles, stored in a word-sense dictionary, and (3) surface
grammatical knowledge, stored in a formal grammar.

Theoretical Considerations in Information Retrieval Systems

Information storage and retrieval systems are composed
of three major components: (a) identification 
<B>of information</B> and tagging it for effective retrieval,
(b) searching strategy, how to enter the file 
to circumvent the scanning of nonrelevant material, and
(c) file organization to make access to information 
efficient.  For identification of information the paper
suggests that a metalanguage (recently discussed 
in a paper by Goffman, Verhoeff and Belzer) associated
with an object language be used.  For searching 
strategy, a linear model for an evaluation function
of relevancy is developed which rewards the system 
for retrieving relevant documents and not retrieving
the nonrelevant, and penalizes the system for the 
escaped relevant documents and false drops.  The inadequacies
of a linear model are indicated.  Two approaches 
to file organization are discussed.  One is self-organization
of the file based on its history and past 
performance, and the second is a self-generating subset
of the file with a high probability of being 
relevant.

The Use of Normal Multiplication Tables
for Information Storage and Retrieval

This paper describes a method for the organization and retrieval of attribute 
based information systems, using the normal multiplication table as a directory
for the information system.  Algorithms for the organization an
d retrieval <B>of information</B> are described.  This method is particularly
suitable for queries requesting a group of information items,
 all of which possess a particular set of attributes (and possibly
some other attributes as well).  Several examples are given; the
results with respect to the number of disk accesses and disk space
are compared to other common approaches.  Algorithms evaluating
the appropriateness of the above approach to a given information system
are described.  For a certain class of information systems,
the normal multiplication table method yields far more rapid retrieval
with a more economical space requirement than conventional systems.  
Moreover this method incorporates an improved modification of the inverted 
file technique.

Performance of Systems Used for Data Transmission
Transfer Rate of Information Bits -An ASA Tutorial 
Standard

Information thruput as a characteristic of
systems performance is discussed.  This discussion 
includes the pertinent aspects <B>of information</B> transfer,
of determination of transfer rate of information 
bits (TRIB), of residual errors, and of standard measurement
conditions.  The paper also presents an 
orderly arrangement of characteristics and parameters
that affect information thruput, and some examples 
on procedures for determining a thruput rate in terms of
TRIB.  It concludes that a performance characteristic 
involving information rate can best be expressed as the
TRIB in conjunction with the Residual Error Rate.

Data Manipulation and Programming Problems
in Automatic Information Retrieval

Automatic <B>information retrieval</B> programs require
the manipulation of a variety of different 
data structures, including linear text, sparse matrices,
and tree or list structures.  The main data 
manipulations to be performed in automatic information
systems are first briefly reviewed.  A variety 
of data representations which have been used to describe
structured information are then examined, and 
the characteristics of various processing languages are
outlined in the light of the procedures requiring 
implementation.  Advantages of these programming languages
for the retrieval application are examined, 
and suggestions are made for the design of programming
facilities to aid in information retrieval.

Education Related to the Use of Computers in Organizations

The ACM Curriculum Committee on Computer Education
for Management has been carrying out a study 
on "Curriculum Development in Management Information
Systems Education in Colleges and Universities" 
under a grant from the National Science Foundation.
 This position paper provides a framework for the 
study.  Preliminary conclusions are presented on the
need for education in administrative information 
systems, and appropriate college curricula and courses
are suggested.  Also, the <B>role of</B> professional 
societies and organizations using computers is discussed,
and the plans of the Committee are outlined. 
 The initial approach of the Committee has been to describe
the education necessary for the effective 
use of computers in organizations, to classify the
positions for which education is required, and to 
survey educational programs now available.

A Proposal for a Computer-Based Interactive Scientific Community

Because of the problems created by the explosion
of papers in the mathematical sciences and 
the drawbacks that this places on research, it is suggested
that a tree of all mathematical results and 
terminology be maintained in a multiterminal computer system.
 Users of the system can store in the computer 
an updated file of their current knowledge, and on selecting
a paper to read, they can obtain from the 
computer the minimum subtree of theorems required to bring
them from what they already know to the background 
knowledge which the paper assumes.  Under certain conditions,
means are also provided for the contribution 
of useful comments by the readers of a work and for interaction
between commentators and with the author. 
 This paper describes how the system can be organized
and the role required of readers, writers, and 
commentators.

A Vector Space Model for Automatic Indexing

In a document retrieval, or other pattern matching
environment where stored entities (documents) 
are compared with each other or with incoming patterns
(search requests), it appears that the best indexing 
(property) space is one where each entity lies as far away
from the others as possible; in these circumstances 
the value of an indexing system may be expressible
as a function of the density of the object space; 
in particular, retrieval performance may correlate inversely
with space density.  An approach based on 
space density computations is used to choose an optimum
indexing vocabulary for a collection of documents. 
 Typical evaluation results are shown, demonstrating
the usefulness of the model.

File Organization: The Consecutive Retrieval Property

The consecutive retrieval property is an important
relation between a query set and record 
set.  Its existence enables the design of an information
retrieval system with a minimal search time 
and no redundant storage.  Some important theorems on
the consecutive retrieval property are proved in 
this paper.  Conditions under which the consecutive retrieval
property exists and remain invariant have 
been established.  An outline for designing an information
retrieval system based on the consecutive 
retrieval property is also discussed.

A General-Purpose Display Processing and Tutorial System

ADEPT (A display-Expedited Processing and Tutorial)
system is described.  This system was designed 
to improve man-computer communications by employing
a display unit to interleave tutoring with other 
computer operations such as simulation, programming, and
<B>information retrieval</B>.  It is written in FORTRAN 
IV (G) for the IBM System/360, Model 40, and the IBM 2250
display Unit under Operating System/360.  Adept 
is a cataloged program that controls the standard operating
system by terminating and rescheduling itself 
automatically, relinquishing computer resources allocated
to it, and surrendering control to the operating 
system to perform other jobs.  It expands the power
and flexibility of computer-assisted instruction 
by making immediately available to students, teachers,
and other users, the full resources (system-cataloged 
programs) of the operating system.  Language processors
and compilers, simulation models, mathematical 
solution techniques, stored data, and all other library and
user programs can be incorporated into instructional 
material without reprogramming.  Illustrations of the various
applications are presented and their implications 
are discussed.

A Code for Non-numeric Information Processing
Applications in Online Systems

A code has been specifically designed to simplify
the internal information processing operations 
within an online computer system with respect to non-numeric
applications, and to maximize the transfer 
rate of the information channel linking the system and
the system user.  The code has direct application 
to problems in area such as <B>information retrieval</B>, document
classification, computer-aided teaching and 
text editing.  This code, called IPC (Information Processing
Code), is an 8-bit code set constructed 
so that 7, 6, 5 and 4-bit subsets can be easily derived
from the basic set.  The code set is organized 
so that simple binary operations can distinguish between
the numeric alphabetic, special symbol and control 
character codes.  The number of usable characters within
the basic set size may be expanded either by 
use of escape codes included in the set, or by suitable
interpretation of otherwise unassigned codes 
on the basis of the requirements of local environments.
