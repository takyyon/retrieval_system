Snippets for the query:  I'm interested in mechanisms for communicating between disjoint processes, possibly, but not exclusively, in a distributed environment. I would rather see descriptions of complete mechanisms, with or without implementations, as opposed to theoretical work on the abstract problem. Remote procedure calls and message-passing are examples of my interests.

A General Business-Oriented Language Based on Decision Expressions*

The structure of a digital compute programming
language which covers a wide class of business 
and file processing applications is presented.  Such
a structure, based on identifying and incorporating 
into a compiler the aspects common to all processes
of such class, permits writing extremely compact 
programs, even for comparatively complex applications,
in terms of tables of control expressions which 
express only information characteristic of the particular
application.  Furthermore,local changes of 
a process (e.g. changes affecting only one of the output
files involved) can be effected by local modifications 
in the program (e.g. modification of only one entry of the
tables).  This structure also allows for inexpensive 
preparation of loading-speed compilers which translate the
source programs into efficient machine codes. 
 The approach adopted here departs from conventional mechanical
language design philosophies.  It stresses 
the structural analysis of the class of processes to be represented
in the languages, as opposed to emphasizing 
formal (i.e., contents-independent) syntactical definitions.
 It relies exclusively on nonprocedural 
representation of process as sets (tables) of relations
between data and results (there are no control 
statements such as GO TO, etc.), instead of using procedure
descriptions (which are one-to-one translations 
of flowcharts).  Here an invariant pattern of procedure
is identified as characteristic of the class 
of all batch file processes.  This new philosophy has
the potential to overcome well-known deficiencies 
of other business-oriented languages and fully meets
the requirements set by CODASYL for such languages, 
including machine-independence.

Formal Verification of Parallel Programs

Two formal models for parallel computation
are presented: an abstract conceptual model and 
a parallel-program model.  The former model does not
distinguish between control and data states.  The 
latter model includes the capability for the representation
of an infinite set of control states by allowing 
there to be arbitrarily many instruction pointers (or
processes) executing the program.  An induction 
principle is presented which treats the control and
data state sets on the same ground.  Through the 
use of "place variables," it is observed that certain
correctness conditions can be expressed without 
enumeration of the set of all possible control states.
 Examples are presented in which the induction 
principle is used to demonstrate proofs of mutual exclusion.
 It is shown that assertions-oriented proof 
methods are special cases of the induction principle.
A special case of the assertions method, which 
is called parallel place assertions, is shown to be
incomplete.  A formalization of "deadlock" is then 
presented. The concept of a "norm" is introduced, which
yields an extension, to the deadlock problem, 
of Floyd's technique for proving termination.  Also discussed
is an extension of the program model which 
allows each process to have its own local variables
and permits shared global variables.  Correctness 
of certain forms of implementation is also discussed.
 An Appendix is included which relates this work 
to previous work on the satisfiability of certain logical formulas.
