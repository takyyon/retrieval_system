Preliminary Investigation of Techniques
for Automated Reading of Unformatted Text

Methods for converting unstructured printed
material into computer code are experimentally 
investigated.  An operator-controlled mode, depending
on human demarcation of the various regions of 
the page for guiding the scanner, is implemented by
means of a joystick and a CRT display.  This mode, 
for which some performance figures are obtained, is thought
to be suitable for processing very complicated 
material, such as technical journals.  For simpler material,
for instance the "claims" sections of patents, 
and in applications where the utmost accuracy is not necessary,
an unsupervised mode is advocated.  Here, 
the textual portions of the page are located during
a rapid prescan by a rudimentary form of frequency 
analysis.  These areas are then rescanned at a higher
resolution suitable for character recognition. 
 Error rates of the order of 0.1 percent are obtained in
a simple problem involving photographs of telephone 
company meter boards.  Other matters related to the
design of a general purpose page reader, such as 
the segmentation of printed text, the possibility of
time-sharing the scanner, interactive man-machine 
operation, and the facsimile reproduction of illustrations, are discussed.

Performance Evaluation of Highly Concurrent
Computers by Deterministic Simulation

Simulation is presented as a practical technique
for <B>performance evaluation</B> of alternative 
configurations of highly concurrent computers.  A technique
is described for constructing a detailed 
deterministic simulation model of a system.  In the model
a control stream replaces the instruction and 
data streams of the real system.  Simulation of the
system model yields the timing and resource usage 
statistics needed for performance evaluation, without
the necessity of emulating the system.  As a case 
study, the implementation of a simulator of a model
of the CPU-memory subsystem of the IBM 360/91 is 
described.  The results of evaluating some alternative
system designs are discussed.  The experiments 
reveal that, for the case study, the major bottlenecks
in the system are the memory unit and the fixed 
point unit.  Further, it appears that many of the sophisticated
pipelining and buffering technique simplemented 
in the architecture of the IBM 360/91 are of little
value when high-speed (cache) memory is used, as 
in the IBM 360/195.

A Study of Line Overhead in the Arpanet

The form, extent, and effect of the communication line
overhead in the ARPANET are considered. 
 The source of this over head is separated into various
levels of protocol hierarchy and the characteristics 
of each level are summarized.  Then the line efficiency
for various models of system use is studied. 
 Some measurements of line efficiency for the ARPANET are
presented and by extrapolation these measurements 
are used to anticipate overhead in a heavily loaded network.
Similar results are derived for a recently 
proposed network protocol and compared with those for the current system.

An Analytic Model of the Hasp Execution Task Monitor

The HASP Execution Task Monitor periodically
rearranges the OS/360 dispatching chain to give 
tasks preemptive execution priority in inverse order to
that of their cpu utilization history.  The effect 
is to keep the I/O bound tasks active and to prevent
cpu bound tasks from locking out other tasks.  This 
paper develops a simple model of the Execution Task
Monitor and employs it to study the effectiveness 
of the monitor in improving system performance.  A
modified strategy monitor control is investigated 
for the case of task execution in a memory hierarchy of varying speeds.

Language Analysis in the Humanities

The use of the computer in the language-oriented
humanities for exhaustive listing of detail 
(as in indices and concordances) is widespread and accepted
as desirable.  The implications of the computer 
for a "science" of the humanities-a science entailing
gathering data for the construction and testing 
of models-are neither widely recognized nor accepted.
 This paper argues that the computer's  major role 
as to language analysis in the humanities will be the
establishing of such a sciencehus, for those 
areas of the humanities for which rigor and precision
are necessary (e.g. analyzing literature or teaching 
a student to write a composition) the computer
can be a critically important facilitator.

The Cyclic Order Property of Vertices as an Aid in Scene Analysis

A cyclic-order property is defined for bodies bounded by smooth-curved faces.
The property is shown to be useful for analyzing pictures of such bodies,
particularly when the line data extracted from the pictures are imperfect.
This property augments previously known grammatical rules that
determine the existence of three-dimensional bodies corresponding
to given two-dimensional line-structure data.

The Reconstruction of Binary Patterns from Their Projections

Given the horizontal and vertical projections
of a finite binary pattern f, can we construct 
the original pattern f?  In this paper we give a characterization
of patterns that are reconstructable 
from their projection.  Three algorithms are developed
to reconstruct both unambiguous and ambiguous 
patterns.  It is shown that an unambiguous pattern can
be perfectly reconstructed in time m X n and that 
a pattern similar to an ambiguous pattern can also be constructed
in time m X n, where m, n are the dimensions 
of the pattern frame.

Structural Pattern Recognition Of Carotid Pulse
Waves Using A General Waveform Parsing System

A general waveform parsing system with application
to structural <B>pattern recognition</B> of carotid 
pulse waves is described.  The carotid arterial pulse
wave is of medical importance because of variation 
in its structure induced by arterial aging and cardiovascular
disease.  The syntax-driven waveform analysis 
system has been applied with good results to these pulse
waves to detect and measure structural variations. 
 The waveform parsing system is modeled on a compiler-compiler
system and allows the user to enter application 
specific information as data.  It is thus general
enough to be applicable to other waveforms.

Experiments with Some Algorithms that Find
Central Solutions for Pattern Classification

In two-class <B>pattern recognition</B>, it is a standard
technique to have an algorithm finding hyperplanes
which separates the two classes in a linearly separable training
set.  The traditional methods find a hyperplane which separates all
points in the other, but such a hyperplane is not necessarily centered
in the empty space between the two classes.  Since a central
hyperplane does not favor one class or the other, it should have
a lower error rate in classifying new points and is therefore better
than a noncentral hyperplane.  Six algorithms for finding central
hyperplanes are tested on three data sets.  Although frequently
used practice, the modified relaxation algorithm is very poor. 
Three algorithms which are defined in the paper are found to be
quite good.

An Application of Heuristic Search Methods to Edge and Contour Detection

This paper presents a method for detecting edges
and contours in noisy pictures.  The properties 
of an edge are embedded in a figure of merit and the edge
detection problem becomes the problem of minimizing 
the given figure of merit.  This problem can be represented
as a shortest path problem on a graph and 
can be solved using well-known graph search algorithms.
 The relations between this representation of 
the minimization problem and a dynamic programming approach
are discussed, showing that the graph search 
method can lead to substantial improvements in computing
time.  Moreover, if heuristic search methods 
are used, the computing time will depend on the amount
of noise in the picture.  Some experimental results 
are given; these show how various information about the
shape of the contour of an object can be embedded
in the figure of merit, thus allowing the extraction
of contours from noisy picture and the separation 
of touching objects.

Some New Methods of Detecting Step Edges in Digital Pictures

This note describes two operators that respond
to step edges, but not to ramps.  The first 
is similar to the digital Laplacian, but uses the max, rather
than the sum, of the x and y second differences. 
 The second uses the difference between the mean and
median gray levels in a neighborhood.  The outputs 
obtained from these operators applied to a set of test
pictures are compared with each other and with 
the standard digital Laplacian and gradient.  A third
operator, which uses the distance between the center 
and centroid of a neighborhood as an edge value, is also
briefly considered; it turns out to be equivalent 
to one of the standard digital approximations to the gradient.

Detection of Three-Dimensional Patterns of Atoms in Chemical Structures

An algorithm for detecting occurrences of a three-dimensional pattern of
objects within a larger structure is presented.  The search technique
presented uses the geometric structure of the pattern to define
characteristics demanded of candidates for matching. This is useful
in cases where the properties of each atom, considered individually,
do not adequately limit the number of sets of possible matchings.
Several applications of this technique in the field of chemistry
are: (1) in pharmacology: searching for a common constellation
of atoms in molecules possessing similar biological activities;
(2) in X-ray crystallography: fitting a structure or a structural fragment
to a set of peaks in the electron-density distribution of
a Fourier map; (3) in chemical documentation; retrieving from
a file the structures containing specified substructures.

The Editing  of Picture Segmentations Using Local Analysis of Graphs

A major problem in picture processing is the
elimination of the large number of spurious regions 
that result from an initial segmentation by region growing
techniques.  Such regions have been eliminated 
either on the basis of semantic information or on the
basis of size and contrast.  A scheme is presented 
which performs eliminations on the basis of local properties
of the region adjacency graph.  The scheme 
is based on definitions of graph properties which are
satisfied when a spurious region is present; then 
editing is equivalent to fast graph operations.  A number of examples are shown.

Pictorial Pattern Recognition and the
Phase Problem of X-ray Crystallography

The availability of interactive, three-dimensional,
computer graphics systems coupled to powerful 
digital computers encourages the development of algorithms
adapted to this environment.  Pictorial pattern 
recognition techniques make possible a number of approaches
to X-ray structure determination based on 
molecular model building, i.e. the use of chemical information
to frame "structural hypotheses" which 
can computationally be tested and refined by reference
to the experimental data.  Application of standard 
<B>pattern recognition</B> algorithms is hindered by the fact
that the cross-correlation between a model and 
the correct structure cannot be computed because of
a fundamental incompleteness in the measured data. 
 However, it is possible to compute an upper bound to such
a cross-correlation.  A simple example demonstrates 
that this information can be the basis of a technique
for structure determination that can make effective 
use of an interactive graphics system. Model building
by cross-correlations has intrinsic advantages 
over usual crystallographic techniques based on the
autocorrelation or Patterson function, especially 
for large structures.  This is significant, for crystallography
of biological macromolecules hasbeen 
and will continue to be a field of intense interest.

Application of Game Tree Searching Techniques
to Sequential Pattern Recognition

A sequential <B>pattern recognition</B> (SPR) procedure
does not test all the features of a pattern 
at once.  Instead, it selects a feature to be tested.  After
receiving the result of that test, the procedure 
either classifies the unknown pattern or selects another
feature to be tested, etc.  Medical diagnosis 
is an example of SPR.  In this paper the authors suggest
that SPR be viewed as a one-person game played 
against nature (chance).  Virtually all the powerful techniques
developed for searching two-person, strictly 
competitive game trees can easily be incorporated either
directly or by analogy into SPR procedures. 
 In particular, one can incorporate the "mini average
backing-up procedure" and the "gamma procedure," 
which are the analogues of the "minimax backing-up procedure"
and the "alpha-beta procedure," respectively. 
 Some computer simulated experiments in character recognition
are presented.  The results indicate that 
the approach is promising.

Analyzing English Syntax with a Pattern-Learning Parser

A dependency analysis system based on pattern
<B>recognition and</B> learning logic was developed 
to infer word classes and rules of syntactic combination
from experience with text which had been analyzed. 
 The characteristics used to form word classes are the
depth in the dependency tree of each word, the 
direction of its governor and the same features for
each of its immediate neighbors. Syntactic rules 
of combination show the relation of a word to its governor
in the depth pattern of the sentence.  The 
system was tested on 400 elementary basic English sentences
including 300 used earlier by Knowlton in 
a different learning parser of all 400 sentences.  After
experience with 300 sentences it was able to 
generalize with 77 percent accuracy to the next 100.
 In accumulative learning trials after the first 
200 sentences it averaged a probability of .9 for accurately
parsing each new sentence it encountered. 
 It was concluded that the system is adequate for learning
to parse the bulk of basic English but that 
further development is required before conclusions about
its application to ordinary English can be stored. 
 The system is operational and available on
the ARPA/SDC time-shared computing system.

Normalization Techniques for Hand printed Numerals

Family of pattern standardization
techniques based on geometrical projection is applied to a file of
digitized hand printed numerals obtained from sales clerks. The
principle involves transforming a quadrilateral specified in terms
of the convex hull of each pattern into a square. The amount of
overlap within each class of characters versus the amount between classes
is used to evaluate the degree of normalization achieved with respect to other 
published methods including size and shear normalization through moments.

A Software Design and Evaluation System

A critical failure of current software system
design and implementation methodology is that 
the performance of a proposed design is not evaluated
before it is actually implemented.  In this paper 
the reasons for this failure are explored, and a new methodology
which overcomes many of the difficulties 
is proposed.  A system which integrates <B>performance evaluation</B>
with design and implementation is described. 
 This system is based on a simple, high level language
which is used to describe the evolving system 
at all stages of its development.  The source language
description is used as direct input to performance 
analysis and simulation routines.  Using the performance
information obtained from these routines as 
feedback, the problems which adversely affect performance
are detected early enough so that they can 
be corrected without costly major reimplementation of the proposed system.

The Multistore Parser for Hierarchical Syntactic Structures

A syntactic parser is described for hierarchical concatenation patterns
that are presented to the analyzer in the form of linear strings.  Particular
emphasis is given to the system of "significant addresses" by means
of which processing times for large-scale matching procedures
can be substantially reduced.  The description makes frequent use
of examples taken from the fully operational implementation of the
parser in an experimental English sentence analyzer.  By structuring
an area of the computer's central core storage in such a way
that the individual locations of bytes and bits come to represent the
data involved in the matching procedure, the shifting of information
is reduced to a minimum, and the searching of lists is eliminated
altogether.  The matches are traced by means of binary masks
and the state of single bits determines the operational flow of the
procedure.  The method could be implemented with any interpretive
grammar, provided it can be expressed by the functional classification
of the items composing the input hierarchical structures.

Computer Pattern Recognition Techniques: Electrocardiographic Diagnosis

The use of programmed digital computers as general
pattern classification and recognition devices 
is one phase of the current lively interest in artificial
intelligence.  It is important to choose a 
class of signals which is, at present, undergoing a
good deal of visual inspection by trained people 
for the purpose of <B>pattern recognition</B>.  In this way
comparisons between machine and human performance 
may be obtained.  A practical result also serves as additional
motivation.  Clinical electrocardiograms 
make up such a class of signals.  The approach to the
problem presented here centers upon the use of 
multiple adaptive matched filters that classify normalized
signals.  The present report fives some of 
the background for the application of this method.

Performance of Rollback Recovery Systems under Intermittent Failures

A mathematical model of a transaction-oriented
system under intermittent failures is proposed. 
 The system is assumed to operate with a checkpointing
and rollback/recovery method to ensure reliable 
information processing.  The model is used to derive the
principal performance measures, including availability, 
response time, and the system saturation point.

Pattern Width at a Given Angle

That the pattern feature "width as a function
of angle" possesses several possible interpretations 
is demonstrated in this paper, which is a review of
the width concept in pattern <B>recognition and</B> the 
geometrical concept itself.  The object of the work
is to clarify how the word description can be made 
precise so that computer algorithms for feature extraction
may be obtained; the focus is on the theoretical 
subject matter.  The results consist of a set-theoretic
definition of width-at-angle, a theorem relating 
it to the pattern boundary radius vector, and descriptions
of alternate widths.  All widths are calculated 
for an illustrative example; graphical and tabular comparisons
are given.  Substantial variation in width-at-angle 
magnitude is found.  The principal conclusion is that
the set-theoretic width-at-angle is a useful pattern 
feature when it can be easily computed.  Further investigation
of the information contained in only part 
of a width function is recommended for cases where
computation of width-at-angle is difficult.
