Computer Simulation-Discussion of the
Technique and Comparison of Languages 

The purpose of this paper is to present a comparison
of some computer simulation languages 
and of some of the involved in comparing software packages
for digital computers are discussed in Part 
I.  The issue is obvious: users of digital computers
must choose from available languages or write their 
own.  Substantial costs can occur, particularly in training,
implementation and computer time if an inappropriate 
language is chosenore and more computer simulation
languages are being developed: comparisons and 
evaluations of existing languages are useful for designers
and implementers as well as users.  The second 
part is devoted to computer simulation <B>and simulation</B>
languages.  The computational characteristics of 
simulation are discussed with  special attention being
paid to a distinction between continuous and discrete 
change models.  Part III presents a detailed comparison
of six simulation languages and packages: SIMSCRIPT, 
CLP, CSL, GASP, CPSS and SOL.  The characteristics of
each are summarized in a series of tables.  The 
implications of this analysis for designers of languages,
for users, and for implementers are developed. 
 The conclusion of the paper is that the packages now
available for computer simulation offer features 
which none of the more general-purpose packages do and
that analysis of strengths and weaknesses of each 
suggests ways in which both current and future simulation
languages and packages can be improved.

A Software Design and Evaluation System

A critical failure of current software system
design and implementation methodology is that 
the performance of a proposed design is not evaluated
before it is actually implemented.  In this paper 
the reasons for this failure are explored, and a new methodology
which overcomes many of the difficulties 
is proposed.  A system which integrates performance evaluation
with design and implementation is described. 
 This system is based on a simple, high level language
which is used to describe the evolving system 
at all stages of its development.  The source language
description is used as direct input to performance 
analysis <B>and simulation</B> routines.  Using the performance
information obtained from these routines as 
feedback, the problems which adversely affect performance
are detected early enough so that they can 
be corrected without costly major reimplementation of the proposed system.

Interference in Multiprocessor Computer Systems with Interleaved Memory

This paper analyzes the memory interference
caused by several processors simultaneously using 
several memory modules.  Exect results are computed for
a simple model of such a system.   The limiting 
value is derived for the relative degree of memory interference
as the system size increases.  The model 
of the limiting behavior of the system yields approximate
results for the simple model and also suggests 
that the results are valid for a much larger class of models,
including those more nearly like real systems 
that the simple model are tested against some measurements
of program behavior <B>and simulation</B>s of systems 
using memory references from real programs.  The model
results provide a good indication of the performance 
that should be expected from real system of this type.

The Effects of Multiplexing on a Computer-Communications System

A study is made of the way in which asynchronous
time division multiplexing changes the stochastic 
nature of the arrival process from a user to the computer
and, consequently, affects the performance 
of a time-shared computer-communications system.  It is
concluded that while, for certain values of system 
parameters, there is noticeable improvement in the
performance of the computer (model), in the sense 
that time-shared scheduling delays are reduced, these
improvements are offset by the transmission delays 
imposed by multiplexing so that there may be little or
no change in the computer-communications system 
performance.  Analytical <B>and simulation</B> results are
based on the model of the computer-communications 
system being an M/D/1 queue (the multiplexor) in tandem
with a single exponential server (the computer). 
 Analytical results include a general description of the
output process of an M/D/1 queue and the conditions 
under which this output process is approximately Poisson.

Productivity of Multiprogrammed Computers-Progress
in Developing an Analytic Prediction Method

Multiprogramming as it is discussed here is
a mode of computer operation in which two or more
programs are concurrently in processor memory and proceeding,
each using the same central processor unit 
(CPU) and input-output (I/O) channels.  These programs
are actually proceeding intermittently and singly, 
according to eligibility (readiness to proceed) and priority.
 It is useful to be able to represent them 
as proceeding continuously and simultaneously, each
at an effective rate, which may be a fraction of 
that which it would enjoy in the absence of the other
programs.  The effective progress rate of each 
program is sensitive to many detailed characteristics
of itself and its co-residents <B>and simulation</B> has 
been the best available method of predicting it.  This
paper presents the results of progress in developing 
an alternative to simulation, a simulation-tested iterative
computation of these rates under certain 
situations.  The algorithm is sensitive to most of the
factors that control the phenomenon, including 
nonquantitative or topological features of the programs' structures.

A Comparative Analysis of Disk Scheduling Policies

Five well-known scheduling policies for movable
head disks are compared using the performance 
criteria of expected seek time (system oriented)and expected
waiting time (individual I/O request oriented). 
 Both analytical <B>and simulation</B> results are obtained.
 The variance of waiting time is introduced as 
another meaningful measure of performance, showing possible
discrimination against individual requests. 
 Then the choice of a utility function to measure total
performance including system oriented and individual 
request oriented measures is described.  Such a function
allows one to differentiate among the scheduling 
policies over a wide range of input loading conditions.
 The selection and implementation of a maximum 
performance two-policy algorithm are discussed.
