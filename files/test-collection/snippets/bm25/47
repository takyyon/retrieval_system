Automatic Data Structure Selection: An Example and Overview

The use of several levels of abstraction has
proved to be very helpful in constructing and 
maintaining programs.  When programs are designed with abstract
data types such as sets and lists, programmer 
time can be saved by automating the process of filling
in low-level implementation details.  In the past, 
programming systems have provided only a single general
purpose implementation for an abstract type. 
 Thus the programs produced using abstract types were
then inefficient in space or time.  In this paper 
a system for automatically choosing efficient implementations
for abstract types from a library of implementations 
is discussed.  This process is discussed in detail for
an example program.  General issues in data structure 
selection are also reviewed.

Computers and Urban Society

This brief survey of the use of computers in
urban society covers the broad range of activities 
found in any city.  The future scope of applications is
limited only by the imagination and inventiveness 
of future system designers, programmers, analysts, and
decision makers.  The computer can be, if properly 
used, with respect for human dignity and civil liberty,
a significant factor in improving the efficiency 
of the urban process.  It is expected that the benefits
of such computer usage will outweigh the costs 
and that we may look forward to an expansion of such usage.

Language Analysis in the Humanities

The use of the computer in the language-oriented
humanities for exhaustive listing of detail 
(as in indices and concordances) is widespread and accepted
as desirable.  The implications of the computer 
for a "science" of the humanities-a science entailing
gathering data for the construction and testing 
of models-are neither widely recognized nor accepted.
 This paper argues that the computer's  major role 
as to language analysis in the humanities will be the
establishing of such a sciencehus, for those 
areas of the humanities for which rigor and precision
are necessary (e.g. analyzing literature or teaching 
a student to write a composition) the computer
can be a critically important facilitator.

A Survey of Computer Science Offerings In Small Liberal Arts Colleges.

Recent curricular development in computer science
together with student in terest in pursuing 
topics in computer science beyond the usual programming
courses have encouraged small liberal arts colleges 
to expand their offerings.  This paper summarizes the
results of a survey taken to determine the type 
of computer science programs being offered in these
colleges.  The results indicate that over half of 
these colleges either have no computer science
program or offer only programming courses.

Computer-Aided Analysis and Design of Information Systems

This paper describes the use of computer-aided
analysis for the design and development of an 
integrated financial management system by the Navy Material
Command Support Activity (NMCSA).  Computer-aided 
analysis consists of a set of procedures and computer
programs specifically designed to aid in the process 
of applications software design, computer selection
and performance evaluation.  There are four major 
components: Problem Statement Language, Problem Statement
Analyzer, Generator of Alternative Designs, 
and Performance Evaluator. The statement of requirements
was written in ADS (Accurately Defined Systems) 
and analyzed by a Problem Statement Analyzer for ADS.
 The ADS problem definition was supplemented with 
additional information in order to create a complete
problem definition.  The analyzed problem statement 
was translated to the form necessary for use by the
SODA (Systems Optimization and Design Algorithm)
program for the generation of alternative specifications
of program modules and logical database structures.

A University's Educational Program in Computer Science

After a review of the power of contemporary computers,
computer science is defined in several 
ways.  The objectives of computer science education are
stated, and it is asserted that in a North American 
university these will be achieved only through a computer
science department.  The program at Stanford 
University is reviewed as an example.  The appendices
include syllabic of Ph. qualifying examinations 
for Stanford's Computer Science Department.
