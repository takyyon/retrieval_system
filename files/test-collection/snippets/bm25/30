Snippets for the query:  I'd like to find articles describing the use of singular value decomposition in digital image processing. Applications include finding approximations to the original image and restoring images that are subject to noise. An article on the subject is H. Andrews and C. Patterson "Outer product expansions and their uses in digital image processing", American Mathematical Andrews, H. Patterson, C.

Pictorial Pattern Recognition and the
Phase Problem of X-ray Crystallography

The availability of interactive, three-dimensional,
computer graphics systems coupled to powerful 
digital computers encourages the development of algorithms
adapted to this environment.  Pictorial pattern 
recognition techniques make possible a number of approaches
to X-ray structure determination based on 
molecular model building, i.e. the use of chemical information
to frame "structural hypotheses" which 
can computationally be tested and refined by reference
to the experimental data.  Application of standard 
pattern recognition algorithms is hindered by the fact
that the cross-correlation between a model and 
the correct structure cannot be computed because of
a fundamental incompleteness in the measured data. 
 However, it is possible to compute an upper bound to such
a cross-correlation.  A simple example demonstrates 
that this information can be the basis of a technique
for structure determination that can make effective 
use of an interactive graphics system. Model building
by cross-correlations has intrinsic advantages 
over usual crystallographic techniques based on the
autocorrelation or Patterson function, especially 
for large structures.  This is significant, for crystallography
of biological macromolecules hasbeen 
and will continue to be a field of intense interest.

A Note on Information Organization and Storage

Since the logical structure of a data base
can be represented by a tree or graph, it is quite 
natural for us to view the process of designing a data
base as that of constructing a tree or a graph. 
 A general method for constructing such a tree or a graph
is provided.  There are three important elements 
in this general construction method; namely, a set of
binary relations, an algorithm for constructing 
subsets of a set, and an algorithm for selecting an
element from the given set of objects.  The use of 
different relations and algorithms results in different
information structures, as list, tree, ring, 
etc.  Thus the problem of information organization and
storage is reduced to that of defining relations 
and formulating algorithms under a given set of constraints.
 The results presented may be valuable to 
designers as useful design concepts, and may serve as
a basis for developing a formal theory on the subject.

Expanding the Editing Function In Language Data Processing

In automatic abstracting, citation indexing,
mechanical translation and other such procedures, 
editing is required whenever the automatic method leaves
something to be desired.  This paper discusses 
the economy of editing as a function of the amount of condensation
of text in language processing operations, 
and then contends that editing can be regarded as an
opportunity rather than as an unwelcome necessity. 
 "Heavy editing," which goes beyond mere correction
and improvement of computer output, is exemplified 
by the use of a concordance in preparing a survey article
or lecture.  Other opportunities for heavy 
editing are described, chief among them being interpretation and
expansion of computer output in such 
processes as factor analysis.  Applications are described,
such processes as factor analysis.  Applications 
are described, such as the quick, unbiased evaluation
of a large volume of incoming mail or telegrams, 
yielding summary reports not possible for either
humans or computers to produce alone.

Guides to Teaching COBOL

The teaching of COBOL can be divided into
three main subject areas.  They are the syntax of 
COBOL, the use of such syntax in solving any given problem,
and programming concepts.  It is generally 
accepted that some knowledge of the hardware and computer
logic must be possessed by the programmer. 
 The teaching problem arises in determining how thoroughly
a student must know the hardware and logic 
for that computer for which he will write COBOL programs.
 Unfortunately, historical data concerning 
students' programming proficiency is almost non-existent
and, at best, difficult to measure.  How then 
might we approach solving this problem?

Some New Methods of Detecting Step Edges in Digital Pictures

This note describes two operators that respond
to step edges, but not to ramps.  The first 
is similar to the digital Laplacian, but uses the max, rather
than the sum, of the x and y second differences. 
 The second uses the difference between the mean and
median gray levels in a neighborhood.  The outputs 
obtained from these operators applied to a set of test
pictures are compared with each other and with 
the standard digital Laplacian and gradient.  A third
operator, which uses the distance between the center 
and centroid of a neighborhood as an edge value, is also
briefly considered; it turns out to be equivalent 
to one of the standard digital approximations to the gradient.

Integral Equations of Immunology

The inversion of a particular integral equation
of the first (Fredholm) kind is the basic problem 
considered.  The strategy which yielded success consisted
of three essential points: (1) fit the known 
experimental data by a curve with properties which derive
from properties of the (as yet unknown) function; 
(2) stabilize the computation for the unknown function
by using singular value decomposition; (3) constrain 
the unknown function approximation (since it represents
a probability distribution) to be nonnegative. 
 A number of test cases are presented. One set of actual
experimental data is analyzed with the procedures 
presented.

Automatic Segmentation of Cyclic Program Structures
Based on Connectivity and Processor Timing

Time-shared, multiprogrammed, and overlayed batch systems frequently
require segmentation of computer programs into discrete portions.  
These program portions are transferred between executable and
peripheral storage whenever necessary; segmentation of program
s in a manner that  reduces the frequency of such transfers is the
subject of this paper.  Segmentation techniques proposed by C. V.
Ramamoorthy are subject to limitations that arise when the preferred
segment size is not compatible with the physical restrictions
imposed by the available computing equipment.  A generalization of
Ramamoorthy's suggestions is made in order to allow their application 
when circumstances are other than ideal.

Impact of Computers on the Undergraduate Mathematics Curriculum 

The use of computers to permit the widespread application
of mathematical ideas requiring computation 
in science and technology is extremely significant for
the understanding of our current society.  Student 
interest in this development is intense and if properly
utilized should yield a much better understanding 
of mathematical concepts as well as the ideas of programming
and logical structure which have been introduced 
into many fields by the use of computers.  The present
paper suggests that that portion of the undergraduate 
mathematical curriculum which is preparation for the use
of mathematics by persons who are not professional 
mathematicians be modified to include the extensions
and clarifications which are possible because of 
computers.  An early introduction to programming is
desirable to permit a continuing use of automatic 
computation to illustrate and clarify mathematical concepts.
 Following the calculus equation stage an 
intensive introduction to numerical analysis should
be added to the current curriculum.  In addition 
to providing competence in the mostly used computing
techniques, it would permit a more sophisticated 
utilization of the advanced mathematical ideas associated
with complex variables and transform theories.

Computer Formulation of the Equations of Motion Using Tensor Notation

A means is described for extending the area
of application of digital computers beyond the 
numerical data processing stage and reducing the need for
human participation in the formulation of certain 
types of computer problems.  By the use of tensor calculus
and a computer language designed to facilitate 
symbolic mathematical computation, a method has been
devised whereby a digital computer can be used to 
do non-numeric work, that is, symbolic algebraic manipulation
and differentiation. To illustrate the 
techniques involved, a digital computer has been used
to derive the equations of motion of a point mass 
in a general orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system.
 Since this operation involves a formulation in 
terms of first- and second-order differential coefficients,
it provides a good demonstration of a computer's 
capability to do non-numeric work and to assist in the
formulation process which normally precedes the 
numerical data processing stage.  Moreover, this particular
problem serves to illustrate the advantages 
of the mathematical techniques employed.  With the program
prepared for this purpose the computer will 
derive the equations of motion in any coordinate system
requested by the user.   Results are presented 
for the following coordinate systems: cylindrical
polar, spherical polar, and prolate spheroidal.
