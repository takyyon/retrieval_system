A Unifying Approach to Scheduling

This paper presents a scheme for classifying
scheduling algorithms based on an abstract model 
of a scheduling system which formalizes the notion of
priority.  Various classes of scheduling algorithms
are defined and related to existing algorithms.  A
criterion for the implementation efficiency of an 
algorithm is developed and results in the definition
of time-invariant algorithms, which include most 
<B>of the</B> commonly implemented ones.  For time-invariant
algorithms, the dependence of processing rates 
on priorities is derived.  The abstract model provides
a framework for implementing flexible schedulers 
in real operating systems.  The policy-driven scheduler
of Bernstein and Sharp is discussed as an example 
of such an implementation

The Simplex Method of Linear Programming Using LU Decomposition

Standard computer implementations of Dantzig's

the inverse after every step of the method. 
 These implementations have bad round-off error properties.
 This paper gives the theoretical background 
for an implementation which is based up<B>on the</B> LU decomposition,
computed with row interchanges, of the

The Control of Response Times in Multi-Class

The possibility of giving different quality of service to jobs of different
classes by regulating their memory allocation is examined in
the context of a paged computer system.  Two parameterized algorithms
which partiti<B>on the</B> main memory between two classes of jobs are
considered.  Initially, a closed system consisting of a process
or and paging and file devices, with fixed numbers of jobs, is studied
to determine optimal degrees of multiprogramming and the proportion
of processor time devoted to each class.  Applying a decomposition
approach and treating the closed system as a single server,
the response times in an open system with external arrivals are
studied.  The object is to investigate the effect of the memory
alocation parameters on the expected response times under the two algorithms.
Numerical solutions and economical lower bounds for the
expected response times as functions of the control parameters
are obtained.  A way of applying the results to systems with more
than two job classes is indicated.

A Card Format for Reference Files in Information Processing

This paper proposes a card format suitable for
a variety of reference files in information 
processing.  An 80-column IBM card is divided into two
fields-reference material field (columns 1-67) 
and identification field (columns 68-80).  The format
for the reference material is flexible, while the 
format for the identification is rigid.  The reference
material includes basically an index, title, source, 
class, summary and cross reference for each entry. 
The identification includes basically codes for a 
matrix of descriptors, an entry number, and the kind,
major interest, and source <B>of the</B> reference.  The 
identification also provides a choice to identify material
for personal as well as general files.  Since 
this card format is sufficient to identify the material
normally associated with reference files for 
books, articles, programming terms, hardware terms, equipment,
machine systems, abbreviations, etc., it 
is suitable as a standard for card reference files in information processing.

A Fast Method for Solving a Class of Tridiagonal Linear Systems

The solution of linear systems having real, symmetric,
diagonally dominant,tridiagonal coefficient 
matrices with constant diagonals is considered.  It is
proved that the diagonals <B>of the</B> LU decomposition 
converges when floating-point precision.  It is also
proved that the computed LU decomposition converges 
when floating-point arithmetic is used and that the limits
of the LU diagonals using floating point are 
roughly within machine precision of the limits using
real arithmetic.  This fact is exploited to reduce 
the number of floating-point operations required to
solve a linear system from 8n-7 to 5n+2k-3, where 
k is much less than n, the order of the matrix.  If the
elements of the subdiagonals and superdiagonals 
are 1, then only 4n+2k-3 operations are needed.  The
entire LU decomposition takes k words of storage, 
and considerable savings in array subscripting are achieved.
 Upper and lower bounds on k are obtained 
in terms of the ratio of the coefficient matrix diagonal
constants and parameters of the floating-point 
number system.  Various generalizations of these results are discussed.

Models for Parallel Processing WIthin Programs:
Application to CPU:I/O and I/O:I/O Overlap

Approximate queueing models for internal parallel
processing by individual programs in a multiprogrammed 
system are developed in this paper.  The solution technique
is developed by network decomposition.  The 
models are formulated in terms of CPU:I/O and I/O:I/O overlap
and applied to the analysis <B>of the</B>se problems. 
 The percentage performance improvement from CPU:I/O
overlap is found to be greatest for systems which 
are in approximate CPU:I/O utilization balance and for
low degrees of multiprogramming.  The percentage 
improvement from I/O:I/O overlap is found to be greatest
for systemtems in which the I/O system is more 
utilized than the CPU.

 It is shown that in many respects suspicions

the residual corresponding to the Gauss-Jordan solution

Global Optimization by Suppression of Partial Redundancies

The elimination of redundant computations and the moving of invariant
computations out of loops are often done separately, with invariants 
moved outward loop by loop.  We propose to do both at once and
to move each expression directly to the entrance <B>of the</B> outermost
loop in which it is invariant.  This is done by solving a more
general problem, i.e. the elimination of computations performed
twice on a given execution path.  Such computations are termed partially
redundant.  Moreover, the algorithm does not require any graphical
information or restrictions on the shape of the program graph.
Testing this algorithm has shown that its execution cost is nearly
linear with the size of the program, and that it leads
to a smaller optimizer that requires less execution time.

A Mathematical Programming Updating Method Using Modified
Givens Transformations and Applied to LP Problems

An efficient and numerically stable method is presented for the problem of
updating an orthogonal decomposition of a matrix of column (or row) vectors.
The fundamental idea is to add a column (or row) analogous
to adding an additional row of data in a linear least squares problem.
A column (or row) is dropped by a formal scaling with the
imaginary unit,  -1, followed by least squares addition <B>of the</B> column
(or row).  The elimination process for the procedure is successive
ssive application of the Givens transformation in modified (more efficient)
form.  These ideas are illustrated with an implementation
of the revised simplex method.  The algorithm is a general purpose
one that does not account for any particular structure or sparsity
in the equations.  Some suggested computational tests for determining
signs of various controlling parameters in the revised simplex
algorithm are mentioned.  A simple means of constructing
test cases and some sample computing times are presented.

On Generation of Test Problems for Linear Programming Codes

Users of linear programming computer codes have
realized the necessity of evaluating the capacity, 
effectiveness, and accuracy <B>of the</B> solutions provided
by such codes.  Large scale linear programming 
codes at most installations are assumed to be generating correct
solutions without ever having been "bench-marked" 
by test problems with known solutions.  The reason for
this failure to adequately test the codes is that 
rarely are there large problems with known solutions readily
available.  This paper presents a theoretical 
justification and an illustrative implementation of a method
for generating linear programming test problems 
with known solutions.  The method permits the generation
of test problems that are of arbitrary size 
and have a wide range of numerical characteristics.

   A FORMAC Program for the Solution of Linear Boundary and Initial Value 
Problems

  A computer program is described which has been developed for obtaining
approximate solutions to linear initial and boundary-value problems involving 
differential equations. For each problem, input to the program includes:
   1. The equations (in symbolic form) to be satisfied  -  the differential
equations, equations describing auxiliary conditions such as boundary 
conditions, etc.
   2. A numerical description of the regions in which each of the equations
are to be satisfied.
   3. Sets of functions (in symbolic form) to be used in linear combinations
to approximate the solution functions. Give the above input, the program
generates an approximation to the solutions of the specified problemm in terms 
of the specified functions which is optimum <B>in the</B> least-squares sense.

Numerical Solution of a Thin Plate Heat Transfer Problem

The numerical solution of a system of linear
equations resulting from a discrete approximation 
to a thin plate heat transfer problem is considered.
 The slow convergence of point iterative methods 
is analyzed and shown to be caused by one <B>of the</B> boundary
conditions. The difficulty may be removed by 
a standard line iterative technique.

The Emergence of a Profession

Computer programming deals with an enormous
variety of activities and is carried on by people 
with a great variety of backgrounds.  It seems clear
that part but not all of this activity is evolving 
toward a distinct professional field, but that the
scope of this emerging profession, and some of its 
economic, social, and educational characteristics are
as yet by no means well defined.  In this paper, 
these issues are examined and some opinions <B>about the</B>m are expressed.

Numerical Properties <B>of the</B> Ritz-Trefftz Algorithm for Optimal Control

In this paper the Ritz-Trefftz algorithm is applied
to the computer solution of the state regulator 
problem.  The algorithm represents a modification of
the Ritz direct method and is designed to improve 
the speed of solution and the storage requirements to
the point where real-time implementation becomes 
feasible.  The modification is shown to be more stable
computationally than the traditional Ritz approach. 
 The first concern of the paper is to describe the
algorithm and establish its properties as a valid 
and useful numerical technique.  In particular such useful
properties as definiteness and reasonableness 
of condition are established for the method.  The second
part of the paper is devoted to a comparison 
of the new techniques with the standard procedure of
numerically integrating a matrix Riccati equation 
to determine a feedback matrix.  The new technique is
shown to be significantly faster for comparable 
accuracy.

Numerical Solution of Nonlinear Two-Point
Boundary Problems by Finite Difference Methods

Solution of nonlinear two-point boundary-value
problems is often an extremely difficult task. 
 Quite apart from questions <B>of real</B>ity and uniqueness,
there is no established numerical technique for 
this problem.  At present, shooting techniques are the
easiest method of attacking these problems.  When 
these fail, the more difficult method of finite differences
can often be used to obtain a solution.  
This paper gives examples and discusses the finite difference
method for non-linear two-point boundary-value 
problems.
