Machine Controls for Analysis of Variance

A major problem in using the analysis of variance,
as the number of factors increases, is the 
exponential rise in the number of interactions.  Even
though the experimenter may not be <B>interested in</B> 
these interactions it is impossible to ignore them in
most experimental designs because of the problem 
of getting error terms.  It is natural therefore to look
to the computer to handle the bulk of work involved 
in computing the interactions.  A program device
to get the computer to do this is described.

An Application of FORMAC

A nonlinear circuit analysis problem is stated
and the way in which it was solved using FORMAC 
is indicated.  The solution of the problem using FORMAC
was notable since several other methods that 
were tried failed.  The problem is straightforward (although
untenable by hand) but nevertheless involved 
an elaborate use of the FORMAC language.  The program
was fairly large and utilized practically every 
command.  In particular, it made extensive use of the
PART command.  Several tricks were necessary in 
order to circumvent some of the shortcomings of the
FORMAC system.  This paper is more concerned with 
the use of programming techniques in FORMAC than with
the actual engineering problem, although readers 
may be <B>interested in</B> the problem because it is stated
in a general (mathematical) sense and could be 
of interest in areas other than circuit analysis.

Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation

The ACM Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic
Manipulation brought together over four hundred 
people <B>interested in</B> programming languages designed
for manipulation of algebraic formulas and symbol 
strings, in their applications, and in algorithms for
their implementation.  Twenty-eight papers were 
presented, followed by a lively panel discussion of
future directions.  Evening meetings were arranged 
for several interest groups.  The conference was sponsored
by the ACM Special Interest Committee on Symbolic 
and Algebraic Manipulation.  The program committee consisted
of Chairman Jean E. Sammet, Paul Abrahams, 
Thomas E. Cheatham, Max Goldstein, and Douglas Mcllroy.
 Conference arrangements were made by Lewis C. 
Clapp, Daniel Bobrow and James H. Griesmer.-Robert W. Floyd, Editor

Analysis of the Availability of Computer
Systems Using Computer- Aided Algebra

Analytical results, related to the availability
of a computer system constructed of unreliable 
processors, are presented in this paper.  These results
are obtained by using various computer-aided 
algebraic manipulation techniques.  A major purpose of
this paper is to demonstrate that the difficulties 
of obtaining analytical solutions to Markov processes
can be considerably reduced by the application 
of symbol manipulation programs.  Since many physical
systems can be modeled by Markov and semi-Markov 
processes, the potential range of application of these techniques
is much wider than the problem of availability 
analyzed here.

Optimal Storage Allocation for Serial Files

A computer system uses several serial files.  The files reside on a 
direct-access storage device in which storage space is limited.  Records are 
added to the files <B>either by</B> jobs in batch processing mode, or by on-line 
transactions. Each transaction (or job) generates a demand vector which 
designates the space required in each file for record addition. Whenever one 
file runs out of space, the system must be reorganized.  This paper considers 
several criteria for best allocating storage space to the files.

A Code for Non-numeric Information Processing
Applications in Online Systems

A code has been specifically designed to simplify
the internal information processing operations 
within an online computer system with respect to non-numeric
applications, and to maximize the transfer 
rate of the information channel linking the system and
the system user.  The code has direct application 
to problems in area such as information retrieval, document
classification, computer-aided teaching and 
text editing.  This code, called IPC (Information Processing
Code), is an 8-bit code set constructed 
so that 7, 6, 5 and 4-bit subsets can be easily derived
from the basic set.  The code set is organized 
so that simple binary operations can distinguish between
the numeric alphabetic, special symbol and control 
character codes.  The number of usable characters within
the basic set size may be expanded <B>either by</B> 
use of escape codes included in the set, or by suitable
interpretation of otherwise unassigned codes 
on the basis of the requirements of local environments.

On the Expected Lengths of Sequences Generated
in Sorting by Replacement Selecting

In the replacement-selecting technique of sorting,
one is <B>interested in</B> the ratio L(j) of the 
expected length of the j-th sequence generated by the
technique to the number of memory cells used.  
Using complex-variable theory, it is shown that L(j)
-> 2 and that, asymptotically, the average interval 
between sign changes of L(j)-2 is 2.6662.

An Information Algebra - Phase I Report-Language
Structure Group of the CODASYL Development Committee

This report represents the results of the
first phase of the work of the Language Structure 
Group.  The goal of this work is to arrive at a proper
structure for a machine-independent problem-defining 
language, at the systems level of data processing.  The
report is based, for the most part, on a mathematical 
model called "An Information Algebra" developed primarily
by R. Bosak.  It is hoped that this report 
will be read (a) with avid interest by programming language
designers and implementors, and all those 
<B>interested in</B> developing a theoretical approach to data
processing; (b) with interest and understanding 
by professional programmers and systems analysts; and (c)
with appreciation by the businessman-analyst-manager. 
 The authors have not attempted an exhaustive discourse
in this report.  Rather, they have tried to present 
a philosophy to the professional people who are vitally
concerned with providing a working language for 
the systems analyst's use.  They trust that the ideas
in this report will stimulate others to think along 
similar lines.  Questions and comments will be welcomed,
and can be addressed to any of the members of 
the Language Structure Group:  Robert Bosak, System
Development Corporation;  Richard F. Clippinger, 
Honeywell EDP Division;  Carey Dobbs, Remington Rand
Univac Division;  Roy Goldfinger (Chairman), IBM 
Corporation;  Renee B. Jasper, Navy Management Office;
 William Keating, National Cash Register;  George 
Kendrick, General Electric Company;  Jean E. Sammet, IBM Corporation.

Using Page Residency To Select the Working Set Parameter

Denning's method for selecting the working set
parameter, which uses interreference intervals, 
is examined.  Several omissions in his model are noted,
and new assumptions are introduced to overcome 
these omissions.  Using this modified model, Dening's results
on page residency are rederived and reconsidered 
for selecting the working set parameter.
