A Data Definition and Mapping Language

A data definition language i sa declarative
computer language for specifying data structures. 
 Most data definition languages concentrate on the declaration
of logical data structures with little 
concern for how these structures are physically realized
on a computer system.  However, the need for 
data definition languages which describe both the logical
and physical aspects of data is increasingly 
apparent.  Such languages will be a key systems, as well
as in advanced data management systems <B>and distributed</B> 
data bases.  This paper reviews past work in the data
definition language for describing both logical 
and physical aspects of data.  Applications of these
"generalized" data definition languages are also 
discussed.

PLEXUS-An On-Line System for Modeling Neural Networks

A description is presented of PLEXUS, a system
which enables a user to construct and specify 
a neural network, to analyze the output data produced
by the network, and to store and retrieve networks 
and data from a library.  The system, operated entirely
from a digital display unit, interacts directly 
with the user and permits easy and rapid transitions
between the various phases of the modeling process. 
 PLEXUS is designed to complement neurophysiological research
so that the systematic development of neural 
models can be coordinated with experimental work.  PLEXUS
networks are built up from components representing 
individual neurons, external stimuli, and interconnecting
fibers, each component being of a relatively 
detailed nature.  Provision is also made for the <B>use of</B>
experimental data as input to a network.  Convenient 
means for specification and modification of a network and
extensive error-checking capabilities are provided. 
Data resulting from the simulation of a network may be
analyzed by a variety of techniques ranging from 
examinations of the gross characteristics of the data to
the determination of detailed statistical properties.

PEEKABIT, Computer Offspring of Punched
Card PEEKABOO, for Natural Language Searching

The "peekaboo" idea from punched card information
retrieval methods has been mated with the 
idea of superimposed punching to produce a programming
technique which cuts computer run time in half 
on a test search of 33,000 subject index entries.  A search
program using the device has been operational 
since late 1963.  As an item is entered in the store,
an 18-byte mask is created from the item's meaningful 
words using the inclusive OR operation.  If, at search
time, the logical product (using the AND operation) 
of this mask and a similarly constructed question mask
is not equal to the question mask, then one or 
more question words are not present in the store item.
 An equality is in conclusive; the words of the 
store item must be unpacked and compared with question
words.  The present store is made up of over 600,000 
subject index entries estimated to average 60 characters
each.  Longer texts, <B>such as</B> abstracts, could 
be handled by multiple masks.

Evaluation and Selection of File Organization-A Model and System

This work first discusses the factors that
affect file (data base) organization performance, 
an elusive subject, and then presents a methodology, a
model and a programmed system to estimate primarily 
total storage costs and average access time of several
file organizations, given a specific data base, 
query characterization and device-related specifications.
 Based on these estimates, an appropriate file 
structure may be selected for the specific situation.
 The system is a convenient tool to study file 
structures and to facilitate as much as possible the process
of data base structure design and evaluation.

A General Business-Oriented Language Based on Decision Expressions*

The structure of a digital compute programming
language which covers a wide class of business 
and file processing applications is presented.  Such
a structure, based on identifying and incorporating 
into a compiler the aspects common to all processes
of such class, permits writing extremely compact 
programs, even for comparatively complex applications,
in terms of tables of control expressions which 
express only information characteristic of the particular
application.  Furthermore,local changes of 
a process (e.g. changes affecting only one of the output
files involved) can be effected by local modifications 
in the program (e.g. modification of only one entry of the
tables).  This structure also allows for inexpensive 
preparation of loading-speed compilers which translate the
source programs into efficient machine codes. 
 The approach adopted here departs from conventional mechanical
language design philosophies.  It stresses 
the structural analysis of the class of processes to be represented
in the languages, as opposed to emphasizing 
formal (i.e., contents-independent) syntactical definitions.
 It relies exclusively on nonprocedural 
representation of process as sets (tables) of relations
between data and results (there are no control 
statements <B>such as</B> GO TO, etc.), instead of using procedure
descriptions (which are one-to-one translations 
of flowcharts).  Here an invariant pattern of procedure
is identified as characteristic of the class 
of all batch file processes.  This new philosophy has
the potential to overcome well-known deficiencies 
of other business-oriented languages and fully meets
the requirements set by CODASYL for such languages, 
including machine-independence.

Variable-Precision Exponentiation

A previous paper presented an efficient algorithm,
called the Recomputation Algorithm, for 
evaluating a rational expression to within any desired tolerance
on a computer which performs variable-precision 
arithmetic operations.  The Recomputation Algorithm can be
applied to expressions involving any variable-precision 
operations having O(10^(-p) + SUM{|Ei|}) error bounds,
where p denotes the operation's precision and 
Ei denotes the error in the operation's ith argument.
 This paper presents an efficient variable-precision 
exponential operation with an error bound of the above
order.  Other operations <B>such as</B> log, sin, and 
cos, which have simple series expansions, can be handled similarly.

to enhance the administrative  attractiveness of the
using agencies in the eyes of funders rather than 
to increase their internal administrative efficiency. 
This impact is a joint product of both the technical 
features of the computer-based system and of the organizational
demands placed upon different agencies, 
administrators, and caseworkers.  It illustrates the
way "successful" automated <B>information system</B>s fit

Multi-attribute Retrieval with Combined Indexes

In this paper a file organization scheme designed to
replace the <B>use of</B> the popular secondary index filing scheme
(or inverted files on secondary key fields) is described.
Through the use of redundancy and storing 
keys (or access numbers of the records) that satisfy different combinations
of secondary index values in "buckets," it is possible to retrieve
all keys satisfying any input query derived from a subset of
fields by a single access to an index file, although each bucket may
be used for many combinations of values and a combination of
buckets may be required for a given query.  The method which, in its
degenerate case, becomes the conventional secondary index filing
scheme works similarly but has the following advantages: (1) the elimination
of multiple accesses in many cases; (2) the elimination
of false drops; (3) the elimination of computer time to perform intersection
of key sets each qualified for one secondary index field
only; and (4) the avoidance of long strings of keys when an index
field appearing in a query has very few possible values.  Redundancy, in some 
cases, is the same as the secondary indexing method. In the general case, 
trade-off between the number of accesses for query and redundancy exists.

Multi-attribute Retrieval with Combined Indexes

In this paper a file organization scheme designed to
replace the use of the popular <B>secondary index</B> filing scheme
(or inverted files on secondary key fields) is described.
Through the use of redundancy and storing 
keys (or access numbers of the records) that satisfy different combinations
of secondary index values in "buckets," it is possible to retrieve
all keys satisfying any input query derived from a subset of
fields by a single access to an index file, although each bucket may
be used for many combinations of values and a combination of
buckets may be required for a given query.  The method which, in its
degenerate case, becomes the conventional secondary index filing
scheme works similarly but has the following advantages: (1) the elimination
of multiple accesses in many cases; (2) the elimination
of false drops; (3) the elimination of computer time to perform intersection
of key sets each qualified for one secondary index field
only; and (4) the avoidance of long strings of keys when an index
field appearing in a query has very few possible values.  Redundancy, in some 
cases, is the same as the secondary indexing method. In the general case, 
trade-off between the number of accesses for query and redundancy exists.

A Note on Information Organization and Storage

Since the logical structure of a data base
can be represented by a tree or graph, it is quite 
natural for us to view the process of designing a data
base as that of constructing a tree or a graph. 
 A general method for constructing such a tree or a graph
is provided.  There are three important elements 
in this general construction method; namely, a set of
binary relations, an algorithm for constructing 
subsets of a set, and an algorithm for selecting an
element from the given set of objects.  <B>The use</B> of 
different relations and algorithms results in different
information structures, as list, tree, ring, 
etc.  Thus the problem of information organization and
storage is reduced to that of defining relations 
and formulating algorithms under a given set of constraints.
 The results presented may be valuable to 
designers as useful design concepts, and may serve as
a basis for developing a formal theory on the subject.

The Multics Virtual Memory: Concepts and Design

As experience with <B>use of</B> on-line operating
systems has grown, the need to share information 
among system users has become increasingly apparent.
 Many contemporary systems permit some degree of 
sharing.  Usually, sharing is accomplished by allowing
several users to share data via input and output 
of information stored in files kept in secondary storage.
 Through the use of segmentation, however, 
Multics provides direct hardware addressing by user and
system programs of all information, independent 
of its physical storage location.  Information is stored
in segments each of which is potentially sharable 
and carries its own independent attributes of size and access
privilege.  Here, the design and implementation 
considerations of segmentation and sharing in Multics
are first discussed under the assumption that all 
information resides in large, segmented main memory. 
Since the size of main memory on contemporary systems 
is rather limited, it is then shown how the Multics
software achieves the effect of a large segmented 
main memory through the use of the Honeywell
645 segmentation and paging hardware.

Digital Simulation of Discrete Flow Systems*

The discrete flow systems discussed are characterized
by the movement of randomly arriving 
items along interacting channels.  Programing a digital
computer to simulate such systems utilizes some 
techniques not common in other approaches to physical

a discussion of two simulation studies that illustrate
some of the programming problems involved. One 
is of an extensive package-handling plant, with the
objective being optimization of parameters <B>such as</B> 
storage capacities and processing rates.  In the other,
air traffic flow and control procedures are simulated 
to compare the effects of alternative control decisions.

An Information-Theoretic Approach to
Text Searching in Direct Access Systems

Using direct access computer files of bibliographic
information, an attempt is made to overcome 
one of the problems often associated with information
retrieval, namely, the maintenance and <B>use of</B> large 
dictionaries, the greater part of which is used only
infrequently.  A novel method is presented, which 
maps the hyperbolic frequency distribution.  This is
more suited to implementation on storage devices. 
 This method treats text as a string of characters rather
than words bounded by spaces, and chooses subsets 
of strings such that their frequencies of occurrence are
more even than those of word types.  The members 
of this subset are then used as index keys for retrieval.
The rectangular distribution of key frequencies 
results in a much simplified file organization
and promises considerable cost advantages.

Experimental Evaluation of Information
Retrieval Through a Teletypewriter

Experiments designed to evaluate the capabilities
of mechanized information retrieval systems, 
with emphasis on interactive (man-machine) language and on
some of the mechanical and psychological limitations 
in their design, were conducted at the Moore School information
Systems Laboratory.  The basic assumption 
of the research is that an information retrieval system
that provides for man-machine dialogue at a remote 
inquiry terminal should provide a searcher with many
of the tools which would be available to him were

Improved Event-Scanning Mechanisms for Discrete Event Simulation

Simulation models of large, complex "real-world"
applications have occasionally earned the 
reputation of eating up hours of computer time.  This
problem may be attributed in part to difficulties 
<B>such as</B> slow stochastic convergence.  However, an additional
problem lies in the fact that a significant 
amount of bookkeeping time is required to keep future events
in their proper sequence.  This paper presents 
a method for significantly reducing the time spent scanning
future event lists in discrete event simulations. 
 There models are presented, all of which improve in effectiveness
as the events-list scan problem becomes 
more burdensome.

Generating English Discourse from Semantic Networks

A system is described for generating English
sentences from a form of semantic nets in which 
the nodes are word-sense meanings and the paths are
primarily deep case relations.  The grammar used 
by the system is in the form of a network that imposes
an ordering on a set of syntactic transformations 
that are expressed as LISP functions.  The generation
algorithm uses the information in the semantic 
network to select appropriate generation paths through
the grammar.  The system is designed for use as 
a computational tool that allows a linguist to develop
and study methods for generating surface strings 
from an underlying semantic structure.  Initial finding
with regard to form determiners <B>such as</B> voice, 
form, tense, and mood, some rules for embedding sentences,
and some attention to pronominal substitution 
are reported.  The system is programmed in LISP
1.5 and is available from the authors.

The Use of Normal Multiplication Tables
for Information Storage and Retrieval

This paper describes a method for the organization and retrieval of attribute 
based <B>information system</B>s, using the normal multiplication table as a directory
for the information system.  Algorithms for the organization an
d retrieval of information are described.  This method is particularly
suitable for queries requesting a group of information items,
 all of which possess a particular set of attributes (and possibly
some other attributes as well).  Several examples are given; the
results with respect to the number of disk accesses and disk space
are compared to other common approaches.  Algorithms evaluating
the appropriateness of the above approach to a given information system
are described.  For a certain class of information systems,
the normal multiplication table method yields far more rapid retrieval
with a more economical space requirement than conventional systems.  
Moreover this method incorporates an improved modification of the inverted 
file technique.

Code Extension in ASCII* (An ASA Tutorial)

The American Standard Code for Information
Interchange (ASCII) contains a number of control 
characters associated with the principle of code extension,
that is, with the representation of information 
which cannot be directly represented by means of the characters
in the Code.  The manner of <B>use of</B> these 
characters has not previously been completely described.
 This paper presents a set of mutually consistent 
philosophies regarding code extension applications,
and suggests a corollary set of doctrines for the 
application of the code extension characters.  Distinctions
are drawn between code extension and such 
other concepts as "graphic substitution" or "syntactic
representation" which are often used to meet similar 
requirements.  Also covered are certain topics which
are not truly concerned with code extension but 
which are often linked with it in discussion on code applications.
 The material in this paper is equally 
applicable in principle to the (proposed) ISO international
7-bit code for information interchange.

An Interpretive Input Routine for Linear Programming

In this descriptive article an input code
is presented which greatly simplifies data input 
to any linear programming solution routine, for subsequent
use either as a pedagogical device or for 
solving rather small LP problems.  This latter (limited)
use derives not at all from inherent limitations 
in the code itself, but from an efficiency evaluation:
large LP problems would doubtless benefit from 
an input system more suited for bulk data handling than
the input code described.  From a user's standpoint, 
input appears almost exactly as a textbook presentation
of the LP problem (limited only by a keypunch's 
inability to write subscripts, etc.).  The input interpreter
scans column wise, thus no fixed format 
data preparation is required.  <B>The use</B>r may also, under
very general requirements only, liberally use 
editorial comments throughout the input deck as an
aid in identification, e.g., of row constraints.  
The article includes examples of input, output from a
solution routine presently in use, and a skeleton 
flowchart of the input interpreter.

An Improved Index Sequential Access Method Using Hashed Overflow

The Index Sequential Access Method (ISAM) is
one of the most important file management systems 
used with moveable head disk devices.  This study investigates
the <B>use of</B> an unconventional method of 
treating overflow records.  The method is to use hashing
techniques to allocate space for such records. 
 If certain conditions are satisfied, this is superior
to the conventional ISAM method of chaining the 
overflow records via linked list techniques.  These conditions are:
long overflow chains with significant 
overflow; lack of tight disk space constraints; record
keys which are small compared to the total record 
size; and significant use of the file in the index as opposed
to the sequential mode.  Using hashed overflow, 
the time to locate a record is dependent not on the total
volume of overflow records as in conventional 
ISAM, but on the percentage use of space dedicated to overflow records.

measures of price/performance <B>such as</B> "Grosch's Law" are shown to
be so over simplified as to be meaningless.  Multiple-regression models
predicting system cost as a function of several hardware
characteristics do, however, reveal a market dichotomy.  On one hand there
exists a stable, price predictable market for larger, general
purpose computer systems.  The other market is the developing one
for small business computer systems, a market which is relatively
unstable with low price predictability.

A General-Purpose Display Processing and Tutorial System

ADEPT (A display-Expedited Processing and Tutorial)
system is described.  This system was designed

information retrieval.  It is written in FORTRAN 
IV (G) for the IBM System/360, Model 40, and the IBM 2250
display Unit under Operating System/360.  Adept 
is a cataloged program that controls the standard operating
system by terminating and rescheduling itself 
automatically, relinquishing computer resources allocated
to it, and surrendering control to the operating 
system to perform other jobs.  It expands the power
and flexibility of computer-assisted instruction 
by making immediately available to students, teachers,
and other users, the full resources (system-cataloged 
programs) of the operating system.  Language processors
and compilers, simulation models, mathematical 
solution techniques, stored data, and all other library and
user programs can be incorporated into instructional 
material without reprogramming.  Illustrations of the various
applications are presented and their implications

A Code for Non-numeric Information Processing
Applications in Online Systems

A code has been specifically designed to simplify
the internal information processing operations 
within an online computer system with respect to non-numeric
applications, and to maximize the transfer 
rate of the information channel linking the system and
the system user.  The code has direct application 
to problems in area such as information retrieval, document
classification, computer-aided teaching and 
text editing.  This code, called IPC (Information Processing
Code), is an 8-bit code set constructed 
so that 7, 6, 5 and 4-bit subsets can be easily derived
from the basic set.  The code set is organized 
so that simple binary operations can distinguish between
the numeric alphabetic, special symbol and control 
character codes.  The number of usable characters within
the basic set size may be expanded either by 
<B>use of</B> escape codes included in the set, or by suitable

The Manchester Mark I and Atlas: A His torical Perspective

In 30 years of computer design at Manchester University
two systems stand out: the Mark I (developed 
over the period 1946-49) and the Atlas (1955-62). 
This paper places each computer in its his torical 
context and then describes the architecture and system
software in present-day terminology.  Several 
design concepts <B>such as</B> address-generation and store
management have evolved in the progression from 
Mark I to Atlas.  The wider impact of Manchester innovations
in these and other areas is discussed, and 
the contemporary performance of the Mark I and Atlas is evaluated.

Establishment of the ACM Repository and Principles
of the IR System Applied to its Operation

The history of the establishment of the ACM Repository
at the Moore School, University of Pennsylvania, 
is reviewed briefly.  Two principles are presented as
paramount in the provision of information services: 
(1) easy accessibility to the information files by users
unfamiliar with file organization, and (2) value 
of service exceeding user costs.  These principles serve
as guides in mechanizing the ACM Repository. 
 The main features of the <B>information system</B> are direct
user access via on-line teletypewriter console, 
direct user access to all details of the system organization,
unrestricted and expandable search vocabulary, 
user access through many facets of document indexing,
and stochastic search through linked index terms 
and other file relationships.  The first contribution
to the ACM Repository consisted of 315 documents, 
relating primarily to early research on compilers.  These
documents have been cataloged and indexed and 
the catalog is scheduled to appear in Computing Reviews.
 The indexing system is described in detail. 
 The Main Catalog is used to describe the documents,
and inverted lists are provided by the Repository 
system for retrieval by concept coordination.

The Banking Information System Concept

Most large commercial banks have progressed to
the  point where their major accounting applications 
have been automated and more sophisticated usage of
data processing equipment is being sought.  This, 
coupled with the availability of equipment well suited
to real-time, direct access processing,has led 
to development within some banks of the central file
of data base approach toward a banking information 
system.  The banking <B>information system</B> now serves the
two-fold purpose of providing real-time responses 
to inquires about individual account stasus and providing
more complex combinations of information for 
management use.  Both kinds of processing draw upon a
common store of data contained in the direct access 
central file.  This data base includes indexes which
facilitate cross referencing of account information 
so that all relationships between bank and customer may
be discerned.  In introducing the banking information 
system concept, a gradual approach to account cross-referencing
and file conversion is most prudent. 
 Generally, this system must interface with other computer
applications already existing within the bank.

A Position Paper on Computing and Communications

The effective operation of free enterprise in
creating the envisioned information service industry 
is dependent upon three accomplishments: (1) the restructuring
of our information processing industry 
so that a clear division of costs is made among computing,
communications, and the development of information 
services; (2) the wide use of multiaccess system concepts
so that information services may share in the 
use of computer installations and so that the cost of their
construction is reasonable; and (3) the development 
of public, message-switched communications services so
that adequate provisions are made for information 
security.

Hybrid Simulation Models of Computer Systems

This paper describes the structure and operation
of a hybrid simulation model in which both 
discrete-event simulation and analytic techniques are
combined to produce efficient yet accurate system 
models.  In an example based on a simple hypothetical
computer system, discrete-event simulation is used 
to model the arrival and activation of jobs, and a
central-server queueing network models the <B>use of</B> 
system processors.  The accuracy and efficiency of the
hybrid technique are demonstrated by comparing 
the result and computational costs of the hybrid model of
the example with those of an equivalent simulation-only 
model.

Memory Management and Response Time

This paper presents a computationally tractable
methodology for including accurately the effects 
of finite memory size and workload memory requirements
in queueing network models of computer systems. 
 Empirical analyses and analytic studies based on applying
this methodology to an actual multiaccess 
in teractive system are reported.  Relations between workload
variables <B>such as</B> memory requirement distribution 
and job swap time, and performance measures such as response
time and memory utilization are graphically 
displayed. A multiphase, analytically soluble model is
proposed as being broadly applicable to the analysis 
of in teractive computer systems which use nonpaged memories.
