A Genealogy of Control Structures

The issue of program control structures has
had a history of heated controversy.  To put this 
issue on a solid footing, this paper reviews numerous theoretical
results on control <B>structures and</B> explores 
their practical implications.  The classic result of
Bohm and Jacopini on the theoretical completeness 
of if-then-else and while-do is discussed. Several recent
ideas on control structures are then explored. 
 These include a review of various other control structures,
results on time/space limitations, and theorems 
relating the relative power of control structures under
notions of equivalence.  In conclusion, the impact 
of theoretical results on the practicing programmer and
the importance of one-in, one-out control structures 
as operational abstractions are discussed.  It is argued
further that there is insufficient evidence 
to warrant more than if-then-else, while-do, and their variants.

High Level Programming for Distributed Computing

Programming for distributed and other loosely coupled systems
is a problem of growing interest.  This paper describes an approach
to distributed computing at the level of general purpose programming
languages.  Based on primitive notions of module, message,
and transaction key, the methodology is shown to be independent
of particular languages and machines.  It appears to be useful for
programming a wide range of tasks.  This is part of an ambitious
program of development in advanced programming languages, and relations
with other aspects of the project are also discussed.

A Note on Information Organization and Storage

Since the logical structure of a data base
can be represented by a tree or graph, it is quite 
natural for us to view the process of designing a data
base as that of constructing a tree or a graph. 
 A general method for constructing such a tree or a graph
is provided.  There are three important elements 
in this general construction method; namely, a set of
binary relations, an algorithm for constructing 
subsets of a set, and an algorithm for selecting an
element from the given set of objects.  The use of 
different relations <B>and algorithms</B> results in different
information structures, as list, tree, ring, 
etc.  Thus the problem of information organization and
storage is reduced to that of defining relations 
and formulating algorithms under a given set of constraints.
 The results presented may be valuable to 
designers as useful design concepts, and may serve as
a basis for developing a formal theory on the subject.

A Deductive Question-Answer for Natural Language Inference

The question-answering aspects of the Protosynthex III pro
totype language processing system are described and exemplified in
detail.  The system is written in LISP 1.5 and operates on the Q-32
time-sharing system.  The system's data <B>structures and</B> their semantic
organization, the deductive question-answering formalism of
relational properties and complex-relation-forming operators, and
the question-answering procedures which employ these features in
their operation are all described and illustrated.  Examples of the
system's performance and of the limitations of its question-answering 
capability are presented and discussed.  It is shown that the
use of semantic information in deductive question answering greatly 
facilitates the process, and that a top-down procedure which works
from question to answer enables effective use to be made of this
information.  It is concluded that the development of Protosynthex
III into a practically useful system to work with large data
bases is possible but will require changes in both the data
structures and the algorithms used for question answering.
