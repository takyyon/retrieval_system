Snippets for the query:  I am interested in hidden-line and hidden-surface algorithms for cylinders, toroids, spheres, and cones. This is a rather specialized topic in computer graphics.

An Improved Program-Synthesizing Algorithm and Its Correctness

An improved program-synthesizing algorithm
based on the algorithm proposed by Waldinger and 
Lee in 1969 is given.  In the old algorithm, the program-synthesizing
problem is translated into a theorem-proving 
problem, and a program is obtained by analyzing a proof.
 For the improved algorithm, the analysis is 
not necessary, and a program is obtained as soon as
the proof is completed.  This is achieved by using 
a modified variable tracing mechanism invented by Green
in 1969.  The correctness of the improved algorithm 
is also proved; i.e. the program thus obtained
always satisfies the specification.

Panel Discussion on Computer Appreciation

Session 19 of the ACM 20 th Anniversary Conference
on August 31, 1967, was entitled Education, 
Design Experiments, and Computer Appreciation.  Its second
half consisted of a panel discussion on computer 
appreciation, organized and chaired by Elliot I. Organick.
 The four panelists were Charles H. Davidson, 
Bernard A. Galler, Richard, W. Hamming, and Alan J. Perlis.
 After making prepared statements, the panelists 
were joined in discussion by Andries van Dam and Arthur
Bohn, who had presented papers in the first 
half.  This is a transcript of the panel discussion,
condensed by Dr. Organick and edited by him and 
the panelists.  Some remarks referred to papers by van
Dam and Kahn or to the discussion during the first 
half of the session.  Pertinent papers are included in the references.
