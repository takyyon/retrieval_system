An Overview of the ISPL Computer System Design

This paper explores the advantages of the concurrent
design of the language, operating system, 
and machine (via microcode) to create an interactive programming
laboratory.  It describes the synergistic 
effect that the freedom to move and alter features from
one of these domains to another has had on the 
design of this system (which has not been implemented).
 This freedom simplified both incremental compilation 
and the system's addressing structure, and centralized the
communication mechanisms enabling the construction 
of hierarchical subsystems.  It also suggested an important
new concept for <B>operating systems</B>: separation 
of the scheduling from the maintenance functions in resource
allocation. This separation enables incorporation 
of new scheduling algorithms (decision of what to do) without
endangering the system integration (correctly 
performing the scheduling decisions).

A Unifying Approach to Scheduling

This paper presents a scheme for classifying
scheduling algorithms based on an abstract model 
of a scheduling system which formalizes the notion of
priority.  Various classes of scheduling algorithms
are defined and related to existing algorithms.  A
criterion for the implementation efficiency of an 
algorithm is developed and results in the definition
of time-invariant algorithms, which include most 
of the commonly implemented ones.  For time-invariant
algorithms, the dependence of processing rates 
on priorities is derived.  The abstract model provides
a framework for implementing flexible schedulers 
in real <B>operating systems</B>.  The policy-driven scheduler
of Bernstein and Sharp is discussed as an example 
of such an implementation

Mixed Solutions for the Deadlock Problem

Mixtures of detection, avoidance, and prevention
provide more effective and practical solutions 
to the deadlock problem than any one of these alone.  The
individual techniques can be tailored for subproblems 
of resource allocation and still operate together to
prevent deadlocks.  This paper presents a method, 
based on the concept of the hierarchical operating
system, for constructing appropriate mixtures and 
suggests appropriate subsystems for the most frequently
occurring resource allocation problems

How to Share a Secret

In this paper we show how to divide data D into
n pieces in such a way that D is easily reconstructable from any
k pieces, but even complete knowledge of k - 1 pieces reveals
olutely no information about D.  This technique enables the construction
of robust key management <B>schemes for</B> cryptographic systems
that can function securely and reliably even when misfortunes destroy
half the pieces and security breaches expose all but one of the
remaining pieces.

An Improved Algorithm for Decentralized Extrema-Finding
in Circular Configurations of Processes

This note presents an improvement to LeLann's
algorithm for finding the largest (or smallest) of a set of uniquely
numbered processes arranged in a circle, in which no central
controller exists and the number of processes is not known a priori.
This decentralized algorithm uses a technique of selective
message extinction in order to achieve an average number of
message passes of order (n log n) rather than O(n2).

The Working Set Model for Program Behavior

Probably the most basic reason behind the absence
of a general treatment of resource allocation 
in modern computer systems is an adequate model for
program behavior.  In this paper a new model, the 
"working set model," is developed. The working set
of pages associated with a process, defined to be 
the collection of its most recently used pages, provides
knowledge vital to the dynamic management of 
paged memories.  "Process" and "working set" are shown to
be manifestations of the same ongoing computational 
activity; then "processor demand" and "memory demand"
are defined; and resource allocation is formulated 
as the problem of balancing demands against available equipment.

Thoth, a Portable Real-Time Operating System 

Thoth isa real-time operating system which is designed to be portable
over a large set of machines.  It is currently running on two minicomputers
with quite different architectures.  Both the system and application
programs which use it are written in a high-level language.
Because the system is implemented by the same software on different
hardware, it has the same interface to user programs.  Hence,
application programs which use Thoth are  highly portable.  Thoth
encourages structuring programs as networks of communicating processes 
by providing efficient interprocess communication primitives.

A Model for Verification of Data Security in Operating Systems

Program verification applied to kernel architectures
forms a promising method for providing 
uncircumventably secure, shared computer systems.  A
precise definition of data security is developed 
here in terms of a general model for <B>operating systems</B>.
 This model is suitable as a basis for verifying 
many of those properties of an operating system which
are necessary to assure reliable enforcement of 
security.  The application of this approach to the
UCLA secure operating system is also discussed.

The Design of the Venus Operating System

The Venus Operating System is an experimental
multiprogramming system which supports five or 
six concurrent users on a small computer.  The system was
produced to test the effect of machine architecture 
on complexity of software.  The system is defined by
a combination of microprograms and software.  The 
microprogram defines a machine with some unusual architectural
feature; the software exploits these features 
to define the operating system as simply as possible.
 In this paper the development of the system is 
described, with particular emphasis on the principles which guided the design.

Considerations in the Design of a Multiple
Computer System with Extended Core Storage

The use of large quantities of addressable
(but not executable) fast random access memory to 
heighten the multiprogramming performance of a multicomputer system
is discussed.  The general design 
of the hardware arrangement and the software components
and functions of such a system are based on a 
planned configuration of dual CDC 6600's that share one
million words of extended core storage.  In the 
generalization of such a design, special emphasis is
placed on estimating expected gains when compared 
with the traditional configuration of separate and independent
computers without extended core storage. 
 An observation is made on the use of conventional, slower
speed, random access storage devices in place 
of the faster memory.

A Model of Memory Contention in a Paging Machine

This paper is concerned with certain aspects of contention
for main memory resources in a multiprogrammed 
computer system operating under demand paging.  In
the model presented, the number of page-frames of 
main memory allocated to a problem program varies in
time.  These changes in memory configuration are 
represented explicitly in the model, CPU requirements and
page exception characteristics of program material 
being described statistically.  Expressions for the distribution
of the number of page-frames allocated 
to an executing program, the long run expected fraction
of a program's execution time in a given number 
of page-frames, and the average execution interval of the
multiprogrammed load are obtained.  It is pointed 
out heuristically and demonstrated numerically that
an increase is obtain able in the average execution 
interval of the multiprogrammed load over that resulting
from equal fixed partitioning of main memory.

Dynamic Verification of Operating System Decisions

Dynamic verification of a decision implies
that every time the decision is made there is a 
consistency check performed on the decision using independent
hardware and software.  The dynamic verification 
of operating system decisions is used on the PRIME system
being designed and constructed at the University 
of California, Berkeley.  PRIME is an experimental time-sharing
which is to have the properties of continuous 
availability, data privacy, and cost effectiveness.
 The technique of dynamic verification allows the 
construction of an operating system which does not make certain
decisions improperly even in the presence 
of a single hardware or software fault.  Furthermore,
multiple faults lead to unreliable operation only 
if the faults happen to reinforce each other.  On PRIME,
dynamic verification is used to ensure that 
one user's information cannot become available to another
user gratuitously even in the presence of a 
single hardware or software fault.the amount of additional
hardware and software required for dynamic 
verification can be modest.

On the Implementation of Security Measures in Information Systems

The security of an information system may be
represented by a model matrix whose elements are 
decision rules and whose row and column indices are
users and data items respectively.  A set of four 
functions is used to access this matrix at translation
and execution time.  Distinguishing between data 
dependent and data independent decision rules enables
one to perform much of the checking of security 
only once at translation time rather than repeatedly
at execution time.  The model is used to explain 
security features of several existing systems, and serves
as a framework for a proposal for general security 
system implementation within today's languages and <B>operating systems</B>.

Resource Management for a Medium Scale Time-Sharing Operating system

Task scheduling and resource balancing for
a medium size virtual memory paging machine are 
discussed in relation to a combined batch processing
and time-sharing environment.  A synopsis is given 
of the task scheduling and paging algorithms that were implemented,
and the results of comparative simulation 
are given by tracing the development of the algorithms
through six predecessor versions.  Throughout 
the discussion particular emphasis is placed on balancing
the system performance relative to the characteristics 
of all the system resources.  Simulation results relative
to alternate hardware characteristics and the 
effects of program mix and loading variations are also presented.

A High Security Log-in Procedure

The protection of time sharing systems from
unauthorized users is often achieved by the use 
of passwords.  By using one-way ciphers to code the passwords,
the risks involved with storing the passwords 
in the computer can be avoided.  We discuss the selection
of a suitable one-way cipher and suggest that 
for this purpose polynomials over a prime modulus are
superior to one-way ciphers derived from Sannon 
codes.

The Nucleus of a Multiprogramming System

This paper describes the philosophy and structure of a multiprogramming system 
that can be extended with a hierarchy of <B>operating systems</B> to suit diverse 
requirements of program scheduling and resource allocation.  The system
nucleus simulates an environment in which program execution and input/output
are handled uniformly as parallel, cooperating process
es.  A fundamental set of primitives allows the dynamic creation and control
of a hierarchy of processes as well as the communication among them.

Spelling Correction in Systems Programs

Several specialized techniques are shown for efficiently
incorporating spelling correction algorithms in
to compilers and <B>operating systems</B>.  These include the use of syntax
and semantics information, the organization of restricted keyword
and symbol tables, and the consideration of a limited class of spelling
errors.  Sample 360 coding for performing spelling correction
is presented.  By using systems which perform spelling correction,
the number of debugging runs per program has been decreased,
saving both programmer and machine time.

The Design, Implementation, and Evaluation of a Working Set Dispatcher

The behavior of a computer system is largely
dependent upon the algorithms employed to allocate 
the system resources to the processes competing for them.
 Recent research in time-sharing paging systems 
has developed the working set model for program behavior,
and are source allocation strategy based on 
this model has been proposed.  Two implementations
along these principles have been reported, but it 
seems that in neither case have further results been
announced.  This report discusses the design and 
implementation of a dispatcher based on the working set
principle, presents data to permit analysis of 
its behavior, and indicates future directions of research
on methods of controlling a computer system.

Analysis of Interleaved Memory Systems Using Blockage Buffers

and the analysis of the model by Monte 
Carlo simulation is discussed.  The simulations investigate
the performance of various system structures, 
i.e. <B>schemes for</B> sending instruction and data requests
to the memory system.  Performance is measured 
by determining the distribution of the number of memory
modules in operation during a memory cycle.  
An important observation from these investigations is that
separately grouping instruction and data requests 
for memory can substantially increase the average number
of memory modules in operation during a memory 
cycle.  Results of the simulations and an analytical
study are displayed for various system structures.

Structured Multiprogramming

This paper presents a proposal for structured
representation of multiprogramming in a high 
level language.  The notation used explicitly associates
a data structure shared by concurrent processes 
with operations defined on it.  This clarifies the meaning
of programs and permits a large class of time-dependent 
errors to be caught at compile time.  A combination of
critical regions and event variables enables the 
programmer to control scheduling of resources among
competing processes to any degree desired.  These 
concepts are sufficiently safe to use not only within
<B>operating systems</B> but also within user programs.

A Correctness Proof of a Topology Information
Main tenance Protocol for a Distributed Computer 
Network

In order for the nodes of a distributed computer
network to communicate, each node must have 
information about the network's topology.  Since nodes
and links sometimes crash, a scheme is needed 
to update this information.  One of the major constrain ts
on such a topology information scheme is that 
it may not involve a central controller.  The Topology
Information Protocol that was implemented on the 
MERIT Computer Network is presented and explained; this
protocol is quite general and could be implemented 
on any computer network.  It is based on Baran's "Hot
Potato Heuristic Routing Doctrine."  A correctness 
proof of this Topology Information Protocol is also presented.

A General-Purpose Display Processing and Tutorial System

ADEPT (A display-Expedited Processing and Tutorial)
system is described.  This system was designed 
to improve man-computer communications by employing
a display unit to interleave tutoring with other 
computer operations such as simulation, programming, and
information retrieval.  It is written in FORTRAN 
IV (G) for the IBM System/360, Model 40, and the IBM 2250
display Unit under Operating System/360.  Adept 
is a cataloged program that controls the standard operating
system by terminating and rescheduling itself 
automatically, relinquishing computer resources allocated
to it, and surrendering control to the operating 
system to perform other jobs.  It expands the power
and flexibility of computer-assisted instruction 
by making immediately available to students, teachers,
and other users, the full resources (system-cataloged 
programs) of the operating system.  Language processors
and compilers, simulation models, mathematical 
solution techniques, stored data, and all other library and
user programs can be incorporated into instructional 
material without reprogramming.  Illustrations of the various
applications are presented and their implications 
are discussed.

Three Criteria for Designing Computing Systems to Facilitate Debugging

The designer of a computing system should adopt
explicit criteria for accepting or rejecting 
proposed system features.  Three possible criteria of this
kind are input recordability, input specifiability, 
and asynchronous reproducibility of output.  These criteria
imply that a user can, if he desires, either 
know or control all the influences affecting the content
and extent of his computer's output.  To define 
the scope of the criteria, the notion of an abstract
machine of a programming language and the notion 
of a virtual computer are explained.  Examples of applications
of the criteria concern the reading of 
a time-of-day clock,  the synchronization of parallel
processes, protection in multiprogrammed systems, 
and the assignment of capability indexes.

Capability-Based Addressing

Various addressing schemes making use of segment
tables are examined.  The inadequacies of 
these schemes when dealing with shared addresses are
explained. These inadequacies are traced to the 
lack of an efficient absolute address for objects in
these systems.  The direct use of a capability as 
an address is shown to overcome these difficulties
because it provides the needed absolute address.  
Implementation of capability-based addressing is discussed.
 It is predicted that the use of tags to 
identify capabilities will dominate.  A hardware address
translation scheme which never requires the 
modification of the representation of capabilities is
suggested. The scheme uses a main memory hash table 
for obtaining a segment's location in main memory given
its unique code.  The hash table is avoided for
recently accessed segments by means of a set of associative
registers.  A computer using capability-based 
addressing may be substantially superior to present
systems on the basis of protection, simplicity of 
programming conventions, and efficient implementation.

Monitors: An Operating System Structuring Concept

This paper develops Brinch-Hansen's concept of
a monitor as a method of structuring an operating 
system.  It introduces a form of synchronization, describes
a possible method of implementation in terms 
of semaphores and gives a suitable proof rule.  Illustrative
examples include a single resource scheduler, 
a bounded buffer, an alarm clock, a buffer pool, a
disk head optimizer, and a version of the problem 
of readers and writers.
