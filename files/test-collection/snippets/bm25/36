Snippets for the query:  Articles describing the relationship between data types and concurrency (e.g. what is the type of a process? when is a synchronization attempt between two processes "type correct"? in a message-passing system is there any notion of the types of messages?--i.e. any way to check that the sender of the message and the receiver are both treating the bit stream as some particular type)

A Model for Type Checking

Most current programming languages treat computation
over different classes of objects (e.g. 
numbers, strings, labels and functions).  For correct
compilation and execution, the following question 
then arises: is a program properly constructed so that
its operations and operands are compatible?  The 
activity of answering this question is usually called
type checking.  This paper attempts to isolate 
the notion of type checking and presents a partial
solution to the type checking problem based on the 
notions of abstraction and application of functions. 
In particular, a program is mapped into an expression 
within a decidable subset of the Lambda calculus, which
characterizes the type relations within the program 
and eliminates all other information.  The determination
of the type-wise correctness or incorrectness 
of the program is resolved by reducing its corresponding
Lambda calculus expression to one of two normal 
forms, the constant "correct" for a type-wise correct
program or the constant "error".  An application 
to type checking in Algol 60 is made, and the attendant
problems faced for any notion of type checking 
are discussed.

The Treatment of Data Types in EL1

In constructing a general purpose programming
language, a key issue is providing a sufficient 
set of data types and associated operations in a manner
that permits both natural problem-oriented notation 
and efficient implementation.  The EL1 language contains
a number of features specifically designed to 
simultaneously satisfy both requirements.  The resulting
treatment of data types includes provision for 
programmer-defined data types data types and generic
routines, programmer control over type conversion, 
and very flexible data type behavior, in a context that
allows efficient compiled code and compact data 
representation.
