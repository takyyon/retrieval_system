Automatic Data Structure Choice in a Language of Very High Level

SETL is a set-theoretically oriented language
of very high level whose repertoire of semantic 
objects includes finite sets, ordered n-tuples, and
sets of ordered n-tuples usable as mappings.  This 
paper describes the structure of an optimizer for this
language.  Among other methods of interest, the 
optimizer uses techniques which allow relations of inclusion
and membership to be established, the domains 
and ranges of (tabulated) mappings to be estimated from
above and below, and the single-valuedness of 
(tabulated) mappings to be proved.  Once facts of this
kind have been established, automatic choice of 
data structures becomes possible. The methods employed
are based upon, and extend, known techniques of 
data flow analysis.

A Very High Level Programming Language for Data Processing Applications

Application development today is too labor-in tensive.
 In recent years, very high-level languages 
have been increasingly explored as a solution to this
problem.  The Business Definition Language (BDL) 
is such a language, one aimed at business data processing
problems.  The concepts in BDL mimic those 
which have evolved through the years in businesses using
manual methods.  This results in three different 
sublanguages or components: one for defining the business
forms, one for describing the business organization, 
and one for writing calculations.
