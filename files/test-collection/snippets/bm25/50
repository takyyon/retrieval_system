Resource Management for a Medium Scale Time-Sharing Operating system

Task scheduling and resource balancing for
a medium size virtual memory paging machine are 
discussed in relation to a combined batch processing
and time-sharing environment.  A synopsis is given 
of the task scheduling and paging algorithms that were implemented,
and the results of comparative simulation 
are given by tracing the development of the algorithms
through six predecessor versions.  Throughout 
the discussion particular emphasis is placed on balancing
the system performance relative to the characteristics 
of all the system resources.  Simulation results relative
to alternate hardware characteristics and the 
effects of program mix and loading variations are also presented.

Empirical Working Set Behavior

The working set model for program behavior
has been proposed in recent years as a basis for 
the design of scheduling and paging algorithms.  Although
the words "working set" are now commonly encountered 
in the literature dealing with resource allocation, there
is a dearth of published data on program measurements, 
in the hope that workers in the field might find experimental
evidence upon which to substantiate and 
base theoretical work.

Anomalies with Variable Partition Paging Algorithms

Five types of anomalous behavior which may
occur in paged virtual memory operating systems 
a redefined.  One type of anomaly, for example, concerns
the fact that, with certain reference strings 
and paging algorithms, an increase in mean memory allocation
may result in an increase in fault rate. 
 Two paging algorithms, are examined in terms of their
anomaly potential, and reference string examples 
of various anomalies are presented.  Two paging algorithm
properties, the inclusion property and the 
generalized inclusion property, are discussed and the
anomaly implications of these properties presented.
