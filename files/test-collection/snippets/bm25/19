Generation of Optimal Code for Expressions via Factorization

Given a set of expressions which are to be
compiled, methods are presented for increasing the 
efficiency of the object code produced by first factoring
the expressions, i.e. finding a set of subexpressions 
each of which occurs in two or more other expressions
or subexpressions.  Once all the factors have been 
ascertained, a sequencing procedure is applied which
orders the factors and expressions such that all 
information is computed in the correct sequence and factors
need be retained in memory a minimal amount 
of time.  An assignment algorithm is then executed in
order to minimize the total number of temporary 
storage cells required to hold the results of evaluating
the factors.  In order to make these techniques 
computationally feasible, heuristic procedures are
applied, and hence global optimal results are not 
necessarily generated.  The factorization algorithms
are also <B>applicable to</B> the problem of factoring 
Boolean switching expressions and of factoring polynomials
encountered in symbol manipulating systems.

Data Manipulation and Programming Problems
in Automatic Information Retrieval

Automatic information retrieval programs require
the manipulation of a variety of different 
data structures, including linear text, <B>sparse matrices</B>,
and tree or list structures.  The main data 
manipulations to be performed in automatic information
systems are first briefly reviewed.  A variety 
of data representations which have been used to describe
structured information are then examined, and 
the characteristics of various processing languages are
outlined in the light of the procedures requiring 
implementation.  Advantages of these programming languages
for the retrieval application are examined, 
and suggestions are made for the design of programming
facilities to aid in information retrieval.

A Modification of Warshall's Algorithm for
the Transitive Closure of Binary Relations

An algorithm is given for computing the transitive
closure of a binary relation that is represented 
by a Boolean matrix. The algorithm is similar to Warshall's
although it executes faster for <B>sparse matrices</B>
on most computers, particularly in a paging environment.

On the Probability Distribution of the Values of Binary Trees

An integral equation is derived for the generating
function for binary tree values, the values 
reflecting sorting effort. The analysis does not assume
uniformly distributed branching ratios, and 
therefore is <B>applicable to</B> a family of sorting algorithms
discussed by Hoare, Singleton, and van Emden. 
 The solution to the integral equation indicates that
using more advanced algorithms in the family makes 
only minor reductions in the expected sorting effort,
but substantially reduces the variance in sorting 
effort.  Statistical tests of the values of several
thousand trees containing up to 10,000 points have 
given first, second, and third moments of the value distribution
function in satisfactory agreement with 
the moments computed from the generating function.  The
empirical tests, as well as the analytical results, 
are in agreement with previously published results for the
first moment in the cases of uniform and nonuniform 
distribution of branching ratio, and for the second moment
in the case of uniform distribution of branching 
ratio.
