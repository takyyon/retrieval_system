An Application of FORMAC

A nonlinear circuit analysis problem is stated
and the way in which it was solved using FORMAC 
is indicated.  The solution of the problem using FORMAC
was notable since several other methods that 
were tried failed.  The problem is straightforward (although
untenable by hand) but nevertheless involved 
an elaborate use of the FORMAC language.  The program
was fairly large and utilized practically every 
command.  In particular, it made extensive use of the
PART command.  Several tricks were necessary in 
order to circumvent some of the shortcomings of the
FORMAC system.  This paper is more concerned with 
the use of programming techniques in FORMAC than with
the actual engineering problem, although readers 
may be interested in the problem because it is stated
in a general (mathematical) sense and could be 
of interest in areas other than circuit analysis.

On the Expected Lengths of Sequences Generated
in Sorting by Replacement Selecting

In the replacement-selecting technique of sorting,
one is interested in the ratio L(j) of the 
expected length of the j-th sequence generated by the
technique to the number of memory cells used.  
Using complex-variable theory, it is shown that L(j)
-> 2 and that, asymptotically, the average interval 
between sign changes of L(j)-2 is 2.6662.
