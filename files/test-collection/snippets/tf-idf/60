A Nonrecursive Method of Syntax Specification

The <B>use of</B> the Kleene regular expression notation
for describing algebraic language syntax, 
in particular of ALGOL, is described in this paper. 
A FORTRAN II computer program for carrying out the 
elimination algorithm of Gorn,similar to Gaussian elimination
for linear systems of algebraic equations, 
is described.  This was applied to numerous smaller
languages, including some sublanguage of ALGOL.  
A hand calculation result of the application of the algorithm
to all of ALGOL is given, thus expressing 
the Revised ALGOL 1960 syntax in completely nonrecursive
terms, as far as its context-free portion is 
concerned.  This description in many ways is far more
intuitively understood than the previous recursive 
description, it is suggested.  The paper also includes
results of the machine program, which does not 
include a simplification algorithm.

Dynamic Document Processing

The current role of computers in automatic
document processing is briefly outlined, and some 
reasons are given why the early promise of library automation
and of the mechanization of documentation 
processes has not been fulfilled.  A new dynamic document
environment is then outlined in which clustered
files are searched and information is retrieved following
an interactive user-controlled search process. 
 Methods are described for an automatic query modification
based on user needs, and for a continuous 
reorganization of the stored information as a function of
earlier file processing and of normal collection 
growth.  The proposed procedures provide powerful tools
for information retrieval and for the control 
of dynamic library collections in which new items
are continually added and old ones are retired.

A Stochastic Approach to the Grammatical Coding of English

A computer program is described which will
assign each word in an English text to its form 
class or part of speech.  The program operates at relatively
high speed in only a limited storage space. 
 About half of the word-events in a corpus are identified
through the <B>use of</B> a small dictionary of function 
words and frequently occurring lexical words.  Some suffix
tests and logical-decision rules are employed 
to code additional words.  Finally, the remaining words
are assigned to one class or another on the basis 
of the most probable form classes to occur within the already
identified contexts.  The conditional probabilities 
used as a basis for this coding were empirically derived
from a separate hand-coded corpusn preliminary 
trials, the accuracy of the coder was 91% to 93%, with
obvious ways of improving the algorithm being 
suggested by an analysis of the results.

A Note on Storage Fragmentation and Program Segmentation

The main purpose of this paper is the presentation
of some of the results of a series of simulation 
experiments investigating the phenomenon of storage fragmentation.
 Two different types of storage fragmentation 
are distinguished: (1) external fragmentation, namely the
loss in storage utilization caused by the inability 
to make <B>use of</B> all available storage after it has been
fragmented into a large number of separate blocks; 
and (2) internal fragmentation, the loss of utilization
caused by rounding up a request for storage, 
rather than allocating only the exact number of words required.
 The most striking result is the apparently 
general rule that rounding up requests for storage,
to reduce the number of different sizes of blocks 
coexisting in storage, causes more loss of storage
by increased internal fragmentation than is saved 
by decreased external fragmentation.  Described also are
a method of segment allocation and an accompanying 
technique for segment addressing which take advantage
of the above result.  Evidence is presented of 
possible advantages of the method over conventional paging techniques.

The Use of Normal Multiplication Tables
for Information Storage and Retrieval

This paper describes a method for the organization and retrieval of attribute 
based information systems, using the normal multiplication table as a directory
for the information system.  Algorithms for the organization an
d retrieval of information are described.  This method is particularly
suitable for queries requesting a group of information items,
 all of which possess a particular set of attributes (and possibly
some other attributes as well).  Several examples are given; the
results with respect to the number of disk accesses and disk space
are compared to other common approaches.  Algorithms evaluating
the appropriateness of the above approach to a given information system
are described.  For a certain class of information systems,
the normal multiplication table method yields far more rapid retrieval
with a more economical space requirement than conventional systems.  
Moreover this method incorporates an improved modification of the inverted 
file technique.
