Flow Diagrams, Turing Machines And
Languages With Only Two Formation Rules

In the first part of the paper, flow diagrams
are introduced to represent inter al. mappings 
of a set into itself.  Although not every diagram is
decomposable into a finite number of given base 
diagrams, this becomes true at a semantical level due
to a suitable extension of the given set and of 
the basic mappings defined in it.  Two normalization
methods of flow diagrams are given.  The first has 
three base diagrams; the second, only two.  In the second
part of the paper, the second method is applied 
to the <B>theory of</B> Turing machines.  With every Turing
machine provided with a two-way half-tape, there 
is associated a similar machine, doing essentially
the same job, but working on a tape obtained from 
the first one by interspersing alternate blank squares.
 The new machine belongs to the family, elsewhere 
introduced, generated by composition and iteration from
the two machines L and R.  That family is a proper 
subfamily of the whole family of Turing machines.

The Structure of Programming Languages

In this paper the major components of every
programming language are identified as: (1) the 
elementary program statement, (2) mechanisms for linking
elementary statements together, (3) the means 
by which a program can obtain data inputs.  Several
alternative forms of each of these components are 
also described, compared and evaluated.  Many examples,
frequently from list processing languages, illustrate 
the forms described.  The advantages, disadvantages and
factors influencing the choice of a form of component 
for a language are discussed, and the paper concludes
with the suggestion that programming languages 
evolve toward one which will permit all the most convenient
ways of structuring programs, organizing 
<B>systems and</B> referencing data.

The Denotational Semantics of Programming Languages

This paper is a tutorial introduction to the
<B>theory of</B> programming language semantics developed 
by D. Scott and C. Strachey.  The application of the theory
to formal language specification is demonstrated 
and other applications are surveyed. The first language
considered, LOOP, is very elementary and its 
definition merely introduces the notation and methodology
of the approach.  Then the semantic concepts
of environments, stores, and continuations are introduced
to model classes of programming language features 
and the underlying mathematical theory of computation
due to Scott is motivated and outlined.  Finally, 
the paper presents a formal definition of the language GEDANKEN.

Recursive Data Structures in APL

A mathematical study of three approaches for defining nested
arrays in APL is presented.  Theorems exhibiting the relationships
between the definitional systems are given and illustrated through graph
representations.  One of the approaches is used to define an
APL array to be a recursive data structure equivalent to a tree structure
in which all data is stored at the leaves as homogeneous
arrays of numbers and characters.  An extension of APL is proposed that
includes new primitive functions to manipulate the nesting
level of arrays and new operators to assist in the
construction of data-driven algorithms.
