Snippets for the query:  Articles describing the relationship between data types and concurrency (e.g. what is the type of a process? when is a synchronization attempt between two processes "type correct"? in a message-passing system is there any notion of the types of messages?--i.e. any way to check that the sender of the message and the receiver are both treating the bit stream as some particular type)

The Treatment of Data Types in EL1

In constructing a general purpose programming
language, a key issue is providing a sufficient 
set of data types and associated operations in a manner
that permits both natural problem-oriented notation 
and efficient implementation.  The EL1 language contains
a number of features specifically designed to 
simultaneously satisfy both requirements.  The resulting
treatment of data types includes provision for 
programmer-defined data types data types and generic
routines, programmer control over type conversion, 
and very flexible data type behavior, in a context that
allows efficient compiled code and compact data 
representation.

An Algorithm for Finding a Fundamental Set of Cycles of a Graph

A fast method is presented for finding a fundamental
set of cycles for an undirected finite 
graph.  A spanning tree is grown and the vertices examined
in turn, unexamined vertices being stored 
in a pushdown list to await examination.  One stage
in the process is to take the top element v of the 
pushdown list and examine it, i.e. inspect all those
edges (v,z) of the graph for which z has not yet 
been examined.  If z is already in the tree, a fundamental
cycle is added; if not, the edge (v,z) is 
placed in the tree.  There is exactly one such stage
for each of the n vertices of the graph.  For large 
n, the store required in creases as n^2 and the time as
n^g where g depends on the type of graph involved. 
 g is bounded below by 2 and above by 3, and it is shown
that both bounds are attained.  In terms of 
storage our algorithm is similar to that of Gotlieb and
Corneil and superior to that of Welch; in terms 
of speed it is similar to that of Welch and superior
to that of Gotlieb and Corneil.  Testsshow our 
algorithm to be remarkably efficient (g=2) on random graphs.

A Proposal for Definitions in ALGOL

An extension to ALGOL is proposed for adding
new data types and operators to the language. 
 Definitions may occur in any block heading and terminate
with the block.  They are an integral part 
of the program and are not fixed in the language.  Even
the behavior of existing operators may be redefined. 
 The processing of text containing defined contexts features
a "replacement rule" that eliminates unnecessary 
iterations and temporary storage.  Examples of definition sets
are given for real and complex matrices, 
complex numbers, file processing, and list manipulation.
