A Highly Parallel Algorithm for Approximating
All Zeros of a Polynomial with Only Real Zeros

An algorithm is described based on Newton's
method which simultaneously approximates all zeros 
of a polynomial with only real zeros.  The algorithm, which
is conceptually suitable <B>for parallel</B> computation, 
determines its own starting values so that convergence
to the zeros is guaranteed.  Multiple zeros and 
their multiplicity are readily determined.  At no
point in the method is polynomial deflation used.

Glypnir-A Programming Language for Illiac IV

GLYPNIR is one of the earliest existing languages
designed for programming the Illiac IV computer. 
The syntax of the language is based on ALGOL 60, but has
been extended to allow the programmer explicitly 
to specify the parallelism of his algorithm in terms of 64-word
vectors.  This paper describes the characteristics, 
goals and philosophy of the language, and discusses some
of the problems associated with parallel computer 
architectures.
