A Modification of Warshall's Algorithm for
the Transitive Closure of Binary Relations

An algorithm is given for computing the transitive
closure of a binary relation that is represented 
by a Boolean matrix. The algorithm is similar to Warshall's
although it executes faster for <B>sparse matrices</B>
on most computers, particularly in a paging environment.

Data Manipulation and Programming Problems
in Automatic Information Retrieval

Automatic information retrieval programs require
the manipulation of a variety of different 
data structures, including linear text, <B>sparse matrices</B>,
and tree or list structures.  The main data 
manipulations to be performed in automatic information
systems are first briefly reviewed.  A variety 
of data representations which have been used to describe
structured information are then examined, and 
the characteristics of various processing languages are
outlined in the light of the procedures requiring 
implementation.  Advantages of these programming languages
for the retrieval application are examined, 
and suggestions are made for the design of programming
facilities to aid in information retrieval.

On Computing Certain Elements of the Inverse of a Sparse Matrix

A recursive algorithm for computing the inverse
of a matrix from the LU factors based on relationships 
in Takahashi, et al., is examined.  The formulas for the
algorithm are given; the dependency relationships 
are derived; the computational costs are developed; and some
general comments on application and stability 
are made.
