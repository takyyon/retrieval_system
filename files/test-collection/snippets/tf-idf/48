Dynamic Document Processing

The current role of computers in automatic
document processing is briefly outlined, and some 
reasons are given why the early promise of library automation
and of the mechanization of documentation 
processes has not been fulfilled.  A new dynamic document
environment is then outlined in which clustered
files are searched and information is retrieved following
an interactive user-controlled search process. 
 Methods are described for an automatic query modification
based on user needs, and for a continuous 
reorganization of the stored information as a function of
earlier file processing and of normal collection 
growth.  The proposed procedures provide powerful tools
for <B>information retrieval</B> and for the control 
of dynamic library collections in which new items
are continually added and old ones are retired.

The Use of Normal Multiplication Tables
for Information Storage and Retrieval

This paper describes a method for the organization and retrieval of attribute 
based information systems, using the normal multiplication table as a directory
for the information system.  Algorithms for the organization an
d retrieval <B>of information</B> are described.  This method is particularly
suitable for queries requesting a group of information items,
 all of which possess a particular set of attributes (and possibly
some other attributes as well).  Several examples are given; the
results with respect to the number of disk accesses and disk space
are compared to other common approaches.  Algorithms evaluating
the appropriateness of the above approach to a given information system
are described.  For a certain class of information systems,
the normal multiplication table method yields far more rapid retrieval
with a more economical space requirement than conventional systems.  
Moreover this method incorporates an improved modification of the inverted 
file technique.
