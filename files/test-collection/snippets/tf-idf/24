A Model for Verification of Data Security in Operating Systems

Program verification applied to kernel architectures
forms a promising method for providing 
uncircumventably secure, shared <B>computer systems</B>.  A
precise definition of data security is developed 
here in terms of a general model for operating systems.
 This model is suitable as a basis for verifying 
many of those properties of an operating system which
are necessary to assure reliable enforcement of 
security.  The application of this approach to the
UCLA secure operating system is also discussed.

The Evolution of the Sperry Univac 1100
Series: A His tory, Analysis, and Projection

The 1100 series systems are Sperry Univac's
large-scale main frame <B>computer systems</B>.  Beginning 
with the 1107 in 1962, the 1100 series has progressed
through a succession of eight compatible computer 
models to the latest system, the 1100/80, introduced
in 1977.  The 1100 series hardware architecture 
is based on a 36-bit word, ones complement structure
which obtains one operand from storage and one from 
a high-speed register, or two operands from high-speed
registers.  The 1100 Operating System is designed 
to support a symmetrical multiprocessor configuration
simultaneously providing multiprogrammed batch, 
timesharing, and transaction environments.

The Evolution of the DEC system 10

The DEC system 10, also known as the PDP-10, evolved
from the PDP-6 (circa 1963) over five generations 
of implementations to presently include systems covering
a price range of five to one.  The origin and 
evolution of the hardware, operating system, and languages
are described in terms of technological change, 
user requirements, and user developments. The PDP-10's
contributions to computing technology include: 
accelerating the transition from batch oriented to time
sharing computing systems; transferring hardware 
technology within DEC (and elsewhere) to minicomputer
design and manufacturing; supporting minicomputer 
hardware and software development; and serving as a
model for single user and timeshared interactive 
minicomputer/micro<B>computer systems</B>.

Formal Requirements for Virtualizable Third Generation Architectures

Virtual machine systems have been implemented
on a limited number of third generation computer 
systems, e.g. CP-67 on the IBM 360/67.  From previous
empirical studies, it is known that certain third 
generation <B>computer systems</B>, e.g. the DEC PDP-10, cannot
support a virtual machine system.  In this paper, 
model of a third-generation-like computer system is
developed.  Formal techniques are used to derive 
precise sufficient conditions to test whether such
an architecture can support virtual machines.

Computer-Aided Analysis and Design of Information Systems

This paper describes the use <B>of computer</B>-aided
analysis for the design and development of an 
integrated financial management system by the Navy Material
Command Support Activity (NMCSA).  Computer-aided 
analysis consists of a set of procedures and computer
programs specifically designed to aid in the process 
of applications software design, computer selection
and performance evaluation.  There are four major 
components: Problem Statement Language, Problem Statement
Analyzer, Generator of Alternative Designs, 
and Performance Evaluator. The statement of requirements
was written in ADS (Accurately Defined Systems) 
and analyzed by a Problem Statement Analyzer for ADS.
 The ADS problem definition was supplemented with 
additional information in order to create a complete
problem definition.  The analyzed problem statement 
was translated to the form necessary for use by the
SODA (Systems Optimization and Design Algorithm)
program for the generation of alternative specifications
of program modules and logical database structures.

Effects of Chargeout on User/Manager Attitudes

The relationship of in ternal pricing systems
for computer services (chargeout systems) and 
user management attitudes about their computer-based
information systems is investigated. Evidence is 
provided that the relationship conforms to a general
pattern that would be expected from the hypothesis 
of the four stages of EDP growth [15].  The results also
indicate that the chargeout systems characteristic 
of advanced EDP stage environments are associated with
relatively high levels of positive user attitudes 
and marked increases in EDP training for users. Both factors
are important to the user/manager involvement 
necessary for effective control <B>of computer</B>-based systems.
 Development and main tenance of computer-based 
systems is asserted to be a category of organizational
change.  A "felt need" for the change on the part 
of the user/manager is prerequisite to any change taking
place.  The research methods of behavioral science 
are applied to investigate the user/manager
environment and the effects of chargeout.

Levels of Computer Systems

In building current <B>computer systems</B>, we tend
to break them down into "levels" of control, 
command and communication; in using the system, we break
our problems down correspondingly.  The continued 
use of such a structure raises questions about its effects
on the usefulness of future systems, particularly 
with regard to such trends as time sharing, parallel
programming, and, eventually, systems which learn. 
 In this essay some of these questions are posed, and
the general attitude we must take in pursuing the 
problem further is discussed.

The Use of Interactive Graphics To Solve Numerical Problems

With the advent of on-line (time-sharing) <B>computer systems</B>
and graphic terminals, we have available a new dimension
in numerical problem solving capabilities.  Rather than simply use
the new power to achieve fast turnaround, we can develop interactive
routines which are easy to use and also take advantage of the
insight and visual capabilities of the human problem solver.  Several
on-line systems for general purpose mathematical problem solving
have already been implemented as well as some special purpose
systems for solving problems in a particular area such as ordinary
differential equations.  The advantage of restricting the problem
area is that the interface with a user can be greatly simplified.
In this paper we discuss some of the advantages accrued by such
systems and design considerations for interactive routines.  Furthermore,
an implementation of an on-line least squares data-fitting
program, PEG, is presented with results obtained from empirical
data.  In conclusion, area for future work in this field are discussed.

Three Criteria for Designing Computing Systems to Facilitate Debugging

The designer of a computing system should adopt
explicit criteria for accepting or rejecting 
proposed system features.  Three possible criteria of this
kind are input recordability, input specifiability, 
and asynchronous reproducibility of output.  These criteria
imply that a user can, if he desires, either 
know or control all the influences affecting the content
and extent of his computer's output.  To define 
the scope of the criteria, the notion of an abstract
machine of a programming language and the notion 
of a virtual computer are explained.  Examples of applications
of the criteria concern the reading of 
a time-of-day clock,  the synchronization of parallel
processes, protection in multiprogrammed systems, 
and the assignment of capability indexes.

Feedback Coupled Resource Allocation Policies
in the Multiprogramming- Multiprocessor Computer 
System

Model studies of some integrated, feedback-driven
scheduling systems for multiprogrammed- multiprocessor 
<B>computer systems</B> are presented.  The basic control variables
used are the data-flow rates for the processes 
executing on the CPU.  The model systems feature simulated
continuous-flow and preempt-resume scheduling 
of input-output activity.  Attention is given to the
amount of memory resource required for effective 
processing of the I/O activity (buffer space assignment).
 The model studies used both distribution-driven 
and trace-driven techniques.  Even relatively simple dynamic
schedulers are shown to improve system performance 
(as measured by user CPU time) over that given by optimal
or near-optimal static schedulers imbeded 
in identical system structures and workload environments.
 The improvement is greatest under a heavy 
I/O demand workload.

Considerations in the Design of a Multiple
Computer System with Extended Core Storage

The use of large quantities of addressable
(but not executable) fast random access memory to 
heighten the multiprogramming performance of a multicomputer system
is discussed.  The general design 
of the hardware arrangement and the software components
and functions of such a system are based on a 
planned configuration of dual CDC 6600's that share one
million words of extended core storage.  In the 
generalization of such a design, special emphasis is
placed on estimating expected gains when compared 
with the traditional configuration of separate and independent
computers without extended core storage. 
 An observation is made on the use of conventional, slower
speed, random access storage devices in place 
of the faster memory.

Price/Performance Patterns of U. Computer Systems

Econometric models of the U. computer market have been developed to study 
the relationships between system price and hardware performance.  Single
measures of price/performance such as "Grosch's Law" are shown to
be so over simplified as to be meaningless.  Multiple-regression models
predicting system cost as a function of several hardware
characteristics do, however, reveal a market dichotomy.  On one hand there
exists a stable, price predictable market for larger, general
purpose <B>computer systems</B>.  The other market is the developing one
for small business computer systems, a market which is relatively
