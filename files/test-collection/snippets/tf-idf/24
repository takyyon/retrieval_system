Memory Management and Response Time

This paper presents a computationally tractable
methodology for including accurately the effects 
of finite memory size and workload memory requirements
in queueing network models of computer systems. 
 Empirical analyses and analytic studies based on applying
this methodology to an actual multiaccess 
in teractive system are reported.  Relations between workload
variables such as memory requirement distribution 
and job swap time, and performance measures such as response
time and memory utilization are graphically 
displayed. A multiphase, analytically soluble model is
proposed as being broadly applicable to the analysis 
of in teractive computer systems which use nonpaged memories.

Legal Implications of Computer Use

This paper points out a variety of ways computer
systems used in business and industry can 
be involved in legal entanglements and suggests that
computer specialists have a responsibility to call 
for assistance in forestalling or minimizing those entanglements
during the planning stage.  Techniques 
are suggested for making legal clearance effective with
the least burden on the new technology and for 
achieving a favorable legal climate for it generally.
 Computer specialists also are alerted to potential 
opportunities to interpret to lawyers the technical aspects
of computer systems involved in legal situations.
