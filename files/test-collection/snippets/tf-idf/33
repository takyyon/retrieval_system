On Lions' Counter Example for Gotlieb's Method
for the Construction of School Timetables

The timetable problem <B>is an</B> essentially discrete
problem. Although the discrete problem may 
have no feasible solution, there may exist a solution
to the equivalent continuous problem.  An example 
is given, for which the nondiscrete solution can be
interpreted as a set of timetables, differing from 
week to week, which together satisfy the long-term
requirements of the timetable problem.

A Simple User-Oriented Compiler Source Language
for Programming Automatic Test Equipment

For the nonprogrammer, difficulty in using
a language increases rapidly with the number of 
nonproblem-oriented conventions.  A simple language, even
if inelegant, which considers the user's background 
as part of the problem may be more effective than a source
language containing subtle and more powerful 
capabilities.  The language described in this paper is
used to write computer programs which test electronic 
equipment.  Because this testing process contains few
complex ideas, <B>there is</B> little need for the elegance 
and redundancy of a highly syntax-oriented language.
 A simple and direct language will suffice for the 
problem.  The eventual users of this language are military
depot personnel who cannot he expected to 
have computer programming skill or significant programming
training.  For this nonprogramming-oriented 
user, it was essential to create a language using familiar
engineering statements; programming-oriented 
conventions would have unnecessarily complicated his task.

On the Normalization Requirement of
Divisor in Divide- and- Correct Methods

This paper presents an analysis on the normalization
requirement of the divisor in a divide-and-correct 
method.  Th<B>is an</B>alysis is made subject to the condition
that not more than one correction is required 
to obtain the true quotient character, from the trial
estimate got from the division of a two-precision 
segment of every partial remainder by a suitably rounded
single-precision divisor.  (This segmented division 
is denoted here as a (2, 1) precision basic division.)
 It is found that the normalization requirement 
could be narrowed down to a smaller range of divisors,
provided the magnitude of the character next to 
the leading character of the divisor is known.  If,
however, the normalization is to be eliminated one 
has to choose proper higher precision segments of operands
for the basic division.  Also considered is 
the possibility of eliminating the normalization by an
increase on the number of corrections on the quotient 
estimate got from a (2, 1) precision basic division.
 It is shown that such a scheme is economical only 
for small radices.
