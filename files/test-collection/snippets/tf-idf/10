Some Ideas on Data Types in High-<B>Level Languages</B>

A number of issues are explored concerning the
notion that a data type is a set of values together 
with a set of primitive operations on those values.  Among
these are the need for a notation for iterating 
over the elements of any finite set (instead of the
more narrow for i:= 1 to n notation), the use of 
the domain of an array as a data type, the need for
a simple notation for allowing types of parameters 
to be themselves parameters (but in a restrictive fashion),
and resulting problems with conversion of 
values from one type to another.

CONVERT: A <B>High Level</B> Translation
Definition Language for Data Conversion

This paper describes a high level and nonprocedural
translation definition language, CONVERT, 
which provides very powerful and highly flexible data
restructuring capabilities. Its design is based 
on the simple underlying concept of a form which enables
the users to visualize the translation processes, 
and thus makes data translation a much simpler task. 
"CONVERT" has been chosen for conveying the purpose 
of the language and should not be confused with any
other language or program bearing the same name.

<B>High Level</B> Programming for Distributed Computing

Programming for distributed and other loosely coupled systems
is a problem of growing interest.  This paper describes an approach
to distributed computing at the level of general purpose programming
languages.  Based on primitive notions of module, message,
and transaction key, the methodology is shown to be independent
of particular languages and machines.  It appears to be useful for
programming a wide range of tasks.  This is part of an ambitious
program of development in advanced programming languages, and relations
with other aspects of the project are also discussed.

Automatic Data Structure Choice in a Language of Very <B>High Level</B>

SETL is a set-theoretically oriented language
of very high level whose repertoire of semantic 
objects includes finite sets, ordered n-tuples, and
sets of ordered n-tuples usable as mappings.  This 
paper describes the structure of an optimizer for this
language.  Among other methods of interest, the 
optimizer uses techniques which allow relations of inclusion
and membership to be established, the domains 
and ranges of (tabulated) mappings to be estimated from
above and below, and the single-valuedness of 
(tabulated) mappings to be proved.  Once facts of this
kind have been established, automatic choice of 
data structures becomes possible. The methods employed
are based upon, and extend, known techniques of 
data flow analysis.
