Snippets for the query:  I'm interested in mechanisms for communicating between disjoint processes, possibly, but not exclusively, in a distributed environment. I would rather see descriptions of complete mechanisms, with or without implementations, as opposed to theoretical work on the abstract problem. Remote procedure calls and message-passing are examples of my interests.
