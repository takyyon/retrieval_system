Performance of Systems Used for Data Transmission
Transfer Rate of Information Bits -An ASA Tutorial 
Standard

Information thruput as a characteristic of
systems performance is discussed.  This discussion 
includes the pertinent <B>aspects of</B> information transfer,
of determination of transfer rate of information 
bits (TRIB), of residual errors, and of standard measurement
conditions.  The paper also presents an 
orderly arrangement of characteristics and parameters
that affect information thruput, and some examples 
on procedures for determining a thruput rate in terms of
TRIB.  It concludes that a performance characteristic 
involving information rate can best be expressed as the
TRIB in conjunction with the Residual Error Rate.

A Model for Verification of Data Security in Operating Systems

Program verification applied to kernel architectures
forms a promising method for providing 
uncircumventably secure, shared computer systems.  A
precise definition of data security is developed 
here in terms of a general model for <B>operating systems</B>.
 This model is suitable as a basis for verifying 
many of those properties of an operating system which
are necessary to assure reliable enforcement of 
security.  The application of this approach to the
UCLA secure operating system is also discussed.

An Improved Algorithm for Decentralized Extrema-Finding
in Circular Configurations of Processes

This note presents an improvement to LeLann's
algorithm for finding the largest (or smallest) of a set of uniquely
numbered processes arranged in a circle, in which no central
controller exists and the number of processes is not known a priori.
This decentralized algorithm uses a technique of selective
message extinction in order to achieve an average number of
message passes of order (n log n) rather than O(n2).

Three Criteria for Designing Computing Systems to Facilitate Debugging

The designer of a computing system should adopt
explicit criteria for accepting or rejecting 
proposed system features.  Three possible criteria of this
kind are input recordability, input specifiability, 
and asynchronous reproducibility of output.  These criteria
imply that a user can, if he desires, either 
know or control all the influences affecting the content
and extent of his computer's output.  To define 
the scope of the criteria, the notion of an abstract
machine of a programming language and the notion 
of a virtual computer are explained.  Examples of applications
of the criteria concern the reading of 
a time-of-day clock,  the synchronization of parallel
processes, protection in multiprogrammed systems, 
and the assignment of capability indexes.

Requirements for Advanced Programming Systems for List Processing

List processing systems should be designed to
facilitate production of large programs to manipulate 
large complex symbolic data stores.  This paper presents
an overview of a number of system features which 
the author feels are important to improve the productivity
of programmers working in such domains.  A 
system view it taken, rather than focusing just on language
features, since algorithms must be not only 
coded in a language form, but debugged, modified, made
efficient, and run on data.  Because of this general 
framework,the requirements specified are applicable
to the design of advanced programming systems for 
a wide range of applications.  Three <B>aspects of</B> programming
systems are highlighted: good interactive 
facilities, programmable control structures, and sophisticated
data communication mechanisms.  Interactive 
features are described to facilitate program composition,
entry, testing, debugging, editing, optimization, 
and packaging.  Implementation of a generalized environment
structure model specified would allow programming 
of various control regimes including multiprocesses,
coroutines and backtracking.  Alternative methods 
of procedure invocation required include invocation
by pattern and by monitoring condition.  The  need 
for extended data forms, storage management, and extensibility
are stressed, as is the duality of data 
retrieval and function evaluation.  Syntax directed
input and output of data would facilitate use of 
complex data stores.

Operational Compatibility of Systems-CONVENTIONS

The General Standards Committee of the SHARE
organization has devoted considerable effort to 
the problem <B>of operating</B> a computer efficiently in
view of the growing number of programming systems 
available.  Each of these programming systems has been
coded to utilize a fixed set of hardware components 
without recognizing the fact that others may be occupying
a storage medium required by the first.  These 
incompatibilities are currently resolved by manually setting
up the computer for each system as required. 
 The following set of conventions is being considered
to minimize computer set-up time.  They are of 
sufficiently broad interest that we feel other computer
users should be aware of them. -George F. Ryckman,

Estimates of Distributions of Random Variables
for Certain Computer Communications Traffic Models

A study of multiaccess computer communications has
characterized the distributions underlying an elementary
 model of the user-computer interactive process.  The model used is
elementary in the sense that many of the random variables that
generally are of interest in computer communications studies can be
decomposed into the elements of this model.  Data were examined
from four operational multiaccess systems, and the model is shown to
be robust; that is each of the variables of the model has the
same distribution independent of which of the four systems is being examined. 
It is shown that the gamma distribution can be used to
describe the discrete variables.  Approximations to the gamma distribution
by the exponential distribution are discussed for the systems studied.

User Program Measurement in a Time-Shared Environment

A general discussion of the measurement of
software systems is followed by a description of 
a hardware and software scheme for measuring user programs
in a time-shared environment.  The TX-2 computer 
at MIT Lincoln Laboratory was used for the implementation
of such a system and the characteristics of 
this implementation are reported.  A scenario showing
the system in use is presented.  Finally, it is 
shown how other time-sharing systems may provide similar measuring facilities.

Considerations in the Design of a Multiple
Computer System with Extended Core Storage

The use of large quantities of addressable
(but not executable) fast random access memory to 
heighten the multiprogramming performance of a multicomputer system
is discussed.  The general design 
of the hardware arrangement and the software components
and functions of such a system are based on a 
planned configuration of dual CDC 6600's that share one
million words of extended core storage.  In the 
generalization of such a design, special emphasis is
placed on estimating expected gains when compared 
with the traditional configuration of separate and independent
computers without extended core storage. 
 An observation is made on the use of conventional, slower
speed, random access storage devices in place 
of the faster memory.

The Design, Implementation, and Evaluation of a Working Set Dispatcher

The behavior of a computer system is largely
dependent upon the algorithms employed to allocate 
the system resources to the processes competing for them.
 Recent research in time-sharing paging systems 
has developed the working set model for program behavior,
and are source allocation strategy based on 
this model has been proposed.  Two implementations
along these principles have been reported, but it 
seems that in neither case have further results been
announced.  This report discusses the design and 
implementation of a dispatcher based on the working set
principle, presents data to permit analysis of 
its behavior, and indicates future directions of research
on methods of controlling a computer system.

On the Implementation of Security Measures in Information Systems

The security of an information system may be
represented by a model matrix whose elements are 
decision rules and whose row and column indices are
users and data items respectively.  A set of four 
functions is used to access this matrix at translation
and execution time.  Distinguishing between data 
dependent and data independent decision rules enables
one to perform much of the checking of security 
only once at translation time rather than repeatedly
at execution time.  The model is used to explain 
security features of several existing systems, and serves
as a framework for a proposal for general security 
system implementation within today's languages and <B>operating systems</B>.

Spelling Correction in Systems Programs

Several specialized techniques are shown for efficiently
incorporating spelling correction algorithms in
to compilers and <B>operating systems</B>.  These include the use of syntax
and semantics information, the organization of restricted keyword
and symbol tables, and the consideration of a limited class of spelling
errors.  Sample 360 coding for performing spelling correction
is presented.  By using systems which perform spelling correction,
the number of debugging runs per program has been decreased,
saving both programmer and machine time.

A High Security Log-in Procedure

The protection of time sharing systems from
unauthorized users is often achieved by the use 
of passwords.  By using one-way ciphers to code the passwords,
the risks involved with storing the passwords 
in the computer can be avoided.  We discuss the selection
of a suitable one-way cipher and suggest that 
for this purpose polynomials over a prime modulus are
superior to one-way ciphers derived from Sannon 
codes.
