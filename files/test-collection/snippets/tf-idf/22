A Model for Masking Rotational Latency by Dynamic Disk Allocation

This paper presents the background <B>and algorithms</B>
for masking the rotational latency of a disk 
or drum.  It discusses the anticipatory input and output
of blocks of data to buffer and primary memories 
for a mono-programmed computer system.  A basic permutation
algorithm and several variations are given. 
  Because of the anticipatory nature of the I/O scheduling,
these algorithms are restricted to classes 
of programs with predictable behavior.  While the methods
are not restricted to numerical computations, 
matrix and partial differential equation methods are
typical examples of their use.  It is shown that 
latency may be masked using a small amount of buffer
memory.  The methods discussed are independent of 
the overall size of the data base being considered.

An Interactive Computer Graphics Approach to Surface Representation

An in teractive computer graphics method has been
developed for the rapid generation of arbitrary 
shaped three-dimensional surfaces.  The method is a synthesis
of spline theory <B>and algorithms</B>, an in teractive 
means for man-machine communication, and software for
static or dynamic graphics display.  The basic 
technique employed is a modified lofting method on
which sectional curves are represented by uniform 
B-splines and the surface is in terpolated between sections
by Cardinal splines.  Among the features of 
this method are algorithms which enable in teractive
modification of the B-spline representation of the 
sectional curves.  At all stages of the process, the
spatial information is graphically displayed to 
the user.  Complex surfaces can be created by the combination
of a number of shapes that have been separately 
generated and automatically joined.  The system has been
successfully in terfaced to a variety of analytical 
routines for structural, medical and graphical applications.

A Note on Information Organization and Storage

Since the logical structure of a data base
can be represented by a tree or graph, it is quite 
natural for us to view the process of designing a data
base as that of constructing a tree or a graph. 
 A general method for constructing such a tree or a graph
is provided.  There are three important elements 
in this general construction method; namely, a set of
binary relations, an algorithm for constructing 
subsets of a set, and an algorithm for selecting an
element from the given set of objects.  The use of 
different relations <B>and algorithms</B> results in different
information structures, as list, tree, ring, 
etc.  Thus the problem of information organization and
storage is reduced to that of defining relations 
and formulating algorithms under a given set of constraints.
 The results presented may be valuable to 
designers as useful design concepts, and may serve as
a basis for developing a formal theory on the subject.

CL-1, An Environment for a Compiler

A flexible, large-scale programming system to
facilitate the solution of information processing 
problems and to provide intercommunication between programs
and/or programmers has been developed and 
realized on the IBM 709/7090 computer.  The system is
based on a master file concept and has provisions 
for accepting, storing, and retrieving both descriptions
and instances of large and complex data sets, 
as well as algorithms defined on these data sets.  Both
data <B>and algorithms</B> may be expressed in a family 
of command and descriptive languages.  The concept
of distinct data descriptions and the content and 
use of such descriptions are discussed in some detail.
