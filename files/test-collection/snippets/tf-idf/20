On ALGOL Education: Automatic Grading Programs

Two ALGOL grader programs are presented for
the computer evaluation of student ALGOL programs. 
One is for a beginner's program; it furnishes random data
and checks answers. The other provides a searching 
test of the reliability <B>and efficiency</B> of an integration
procedure.  There is a statement of the essential 
properties of a computer system, in order that
grader programs can be effectively used.

A Study of Line Overhead in the Arpanet

The form, extent, and effect of the communication line
overhead in the ARPANET are considered. 
 The source of this over head is separated into various
levels of protocol hierarchy and the characteristics 
of each level are summarized.  Then the line efficiency
for various models of system use is studied. 
 Some measurements of line efficiency for the ARPANET are
presented and by extrapolation these measurements 
are used to anticipate overhead in a heavily loaded network.
Similar results are derived for a recently 
proposed network protocol and compared with those for the current system.

Hybrid Simulation Models of Computer Systems

This paper describes the structure and operation
of a hybrid simulation model in which both 
discrete-event simulation and analytic techniques are
combined to produce efficient yet accurate system 
models.  In an example based on a simple hypothetical
computer system, discrete-event simulation is used 
to model the arrival and activation of jobs, and a
central-server queueing network models the use of 
system processors.  The accuracy <B>and efficiency</B> of the
hybrid technique are demonstrated by comparing 
the result and computational costs of the hybrid model of
the example with those of an equivalent simulation-only 
model.

Computer Generation of Gamma Random Variates
with Non-integral Shape Parameters

When the shape parameter, a, is integral,
generating gamma random variables with a digital 
computer is straightforward.  There is no simple method
for generating gamma random variates with non-integral 
shape parameters.  A common procedure is to approximately
generate such random variables by use of the 
so-called probability switch method.  Another procedure,
which is exact, is due to Johnk.  This paper 
presents a rejection method for exactly generating
gamma random variables when a is greater than 1.  
The efficiency of the rejection method is shown to
be better than the efficiency of Johnk's method.  
The paper concludes that when a is non-integral the following
mix of procedures yields the best combination 
of accuracy <B>and efficiency</B>: (1) when a is less than
1, use Johnk's method; (2) when 1 is less than a 
and a is less than 5, use the rejection method; (3) when
a is greater than 5, use the probability switch 
method.

Extremely Portable Random Number Generator

Extremely portable subroutines are sometimes
needed for which moderate quality <B>and efficiency</B> 
suffice.  Typically, this occurs for library functions
(like random number generation and in core sorting) 
which are not entirely universal or are not used in a
standardized way.  The literature on random number 
generators does not seem to contain an algorithm that
meets requirements of this sort.  An extremely 
portable 8-line FORTRAN program is provided which based
on an important paper by Coveyou and MacPherson 
(1967)sing their methods, Fourier analysis is applied
to the probability function for the consecutive 
n-tuples provided by our generator (with n less than
or equal to 4).  While the small modulus which must 
be used to maintain portability prevents the quality
of the generator from being high, the generator 
compares well with the bounds established in the above mentioned paper.
