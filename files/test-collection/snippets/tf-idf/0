A Policy-Driven Scheduler for a Time-Sharing System

The service received by a process from a time-sharing
<B>operating system</B> can be characterized 
by a resource count SUM{w[i]R[ij]} where R[ij] is the
number of units of service received by process 
i from resource i and w[i] is the cost per unit of the
service.  Each class of users can be characterized 
by a policy function which specifies the amount of service
a user who belongs to this class should receive 
as a function of time.  Priority changes dynamically
as a function of the difference between the service 
promised to the user by the policy function and the service
he actually receives.  A scheduling and swapping 
algorithm which keeps the resource count of each process
above its policy function will provide the specified 
level of service.  Overhead can be reduced by avoiding
swaps of process which have received at least 
his level of service.  The algorithm has been implemented
in a general purpose operating system, and 
it has provided significantly better service to interactive
and to batch jobs than the previous scheduler.

User Program Measurement in a Time-Shared Environment

A general discussion of the measurement of
software systems is followed by a description of 
a hardware and software scheme for measuring user programs
in a time-shared environment.  The TX-2 computer 
at MIT Lincoln Laboratory was used for the implementation
of such a system and the characteristics of 
this implementation are reported.  A scenario showing
the system in use is presented.  Finally, it is 
shown how other time-sharing systems may provide similar measuring facilities.
