A Proposal for Definitions in ALGOL

An extension to ALGOL is proposed for adding
new data types and operators to the language. 
 Definitions may occur in any block heading and terminate
with the block.  They are an integral part 
of the program and are not fixed in the language.  Even
the behavior of existing operators <B>may be</B> redefined. 
 The processing of text containing defined contexts features
a "replacement rule" that eliminates unnecessary 
iterations and temporary storage.  Examples of definition sets
are given for real and complex matrices, 
complex numbers, file processing, and list manipulation.

Dynamic Storage Allocation Systems

In many recent computer system designs, hardware
facilities have been provided for easing the 
problems of storage allocation.  A method of characterizing
dynamic storage allocation systems-according 
to the functional capabilities provided and the underlying
techniques used-is presented.  The basic purpose 
of the paper is to provide a useful perspective from
which the utility of various hardware facilities 
<B>may be</B> assessed.  A brief survey of storage allocation
facilities in several representative computer 
systems is included as an appendix.

PUFFT-The Purdue University Fast FORTRAN Translator

A core resident, compile-and-go system designed
for the IBM 7090/7094 computer is described. 
 In little more than half of the 32k word core memory
PUFFT provides a monitor for job sequencing, a 
translator for the full FORTRAN IV language, the FORTRAN
subroutine library, an input--output system 
for use at compile time and at execute time, and a rather
elaborate diagnostic message writing routine. 
 Batches of small- and medium-sized FORTRAN IV source
language programs are processed at very high speeds. 
 Language compatibility has been maintained so that
programs <B>may be</B> debugged in the PUFFT system and 
then recompiled and run in the IBJOB-IBFTC system supplied by the manufacturer.

A Simple User-Oriented Compiler Source Language
for Programming Automatic Test Equipment

For the nonprogrammer, difficulty in using
a language increases rapidly with the number of 
nonproblem-oriented conventions.  A simple language, even
if inelegant, which considers the user's background 
as part of the problem <B>may be</B> more effective than a source
language containing subtle and more powerful 
capabilities.  The language described in this paper is
used to write computer programs which test electronic 
equipment.  Because this testing process contains few
complex ideas, there is little need for the elegance 
and redundancy of a highly syntax-oriented language.
 A simple and direct language will suffice for the 
problem.  The eventual users of this language are military
depot personnel who cannot he expected to 
have computer programming skill or significant programming
training.  For this nonprogramming-oriented 
user, it was essential to create a language using familiar
engineering statements; programming-oriented 
conventions would have unnecessarily complicated his task.

A Record and File Partitioning Model

One of the main objectives in the design of
a file system is the reduction of storage and data 
transfer costs.  This paper presents a model in which
several  requests access the file system, and each 
request requires information from one or more variable
length data-items.  The probabilities of access 
and the distribution of each data-item's length are assumed
to be known, and to be mutually independent. 
The file system uses one or more storage devices, and
each record <B>may be</B> partitioned into subrecords 
that are stored on different devices.  One of the subrecords
is designated as the primary record; when 
a request for a record is made, the primary record is
first accessed, and other subrecords are accessed 
only if the pertinent information is not stored in the
primary record.  The model that is presented in 
this paper, both as a nonlinear programming model and
a mixed integer programming model, is a very general 
one; several types of file systems may be derived from
it by an appropriate selection of its parameters. 
 This model has already been used in the optimization of
library routines' storage at a large scale operating 
system.

CONVERT

A programming language is described which
is applicable to problems conveniently described 
by transformation rules.  By this is meant that patterns
<B>may be</B> prescribed, each being associated with 
a skeleton, so that a series of such pairs may be searched
until a pattern is found which matches an 
expression to be transformed.  The conditions for a match
are governed by a code which also allows subexpressions 
to be identified and eventually substituted into the
corresponding skeleton.  The primitive patterns 
and primitive skeletons are described, as well as the
principle which allow their elaboration in to more 
complicated patterns and skeletons.  The advantages of the
language are that it allows one to apply transformation 
rules to lists and arrays as easily as strings, that both
patterns and skeletons may be defined recursively, 
and that as a consequence programs may be stated quite concisely.
